        Netflix viewers got an introduction, this spring, to a famous physics
        experiment: the three-body problem. A magnetized pendulum suspended
        above two fixed magnets will swing between them predictably. A third
        magnet, however, randomizes the motion, not because the laws of physics
        have been repealed, but because the forces involved are too intricate to
        measure. The only way to “model” them is to relate their history. That’s
        what Netflix did in dramatizing the Chinese writer Liu Cixin’s
        science-fiction classic, The Three-Body Problem: a planet light years
        from earth falls within the gravitational attraction of three suns. It’s
        no spoiler to say that the results, for earth, are not auspicious.

        今年春天，通过奈飞(Netflix)的播放，观众们对一个著名的物理学实验有了了解：三体问题。一个磁化的摆悬在两个固定磁铁上方，会按照可预测的方式在两者之间摆动。然而，加入第三个磁铁后，摆动就会变得无规律——不是因为物理定律被废止，而是因为涉及的力太复杂，无法测量。唯一“模拟”它们的方法是追踪它们的历史。奈飞正是这样改编了中国作家刘慈欣的科幻经典《三体》：一颗距地球光年的星球受到三个太阳的引力吸引。不妨事先透露一下，对于地球来说，结果并不吉利。

        Sergey Radchenko, a historian at Johns Hopkins University, comes from
        the East Asian island of Sakhalin, a good place from which to detect
        geopolitical gravitations. His first book bore the appropriate title Two
        Suns in the Heavens: The Sino-Soviet Struggle for Supremacy, 1962–1967.
        His second, Unwanted Visionaries: The Soviet Failure in Asia at the End
        of the Cold War, extended his analysis through the 1980s. Now, with To
        Run the World: The Kremlin’s Cold War Bid for Global Power, Radchenko
        seeks to refocus recent scholarship, which has sought to “decenter” the
        history of that conflict, back on the superpowers for which it was
        originally known.
      </p>
      <p>
        约翰斯·霍普金斯大学的历史学家谢尔盖·拉琴科来自远东的萨哈林岛，该岛是观察地缘政治引力的好地方。他的第一本书书名恰如其分：《天空中的两个太阳：1962至1967年中苏争霸》。第二本《不受欢迎的先知：冷战末期苏联在亚洲的失败》将分析扩展到上世纪80年代。现在，在《统治世界：克里姆林宫的冷战全球争霸》一书中，拉琴科试图将近期那些试图将冷战史“去中心化”的学术研究重新聚焦到这一冲突原本的主角——超级大国——身上。

        Previous accounts of the Soviet Union’s Cold War emphasized
        bipolarities: Marxist-Leninist ideology versus Russian nationalism in
        the “orthodox-revisionist” debates among historians half a century ago;
        then the revolution-versus-imperialism paradigm advanced by the
        expatriate scholars Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshakov in the
        1990s. “Decenterists” have since added a third polarity, contrasting the
        relative stability of the superpowers’ “long peace” with persistent
        violence among their surrogates elsewhere. Cold War history has
        therefore become, in this sense, its own three-body problem. How can we
        begin pulling it back together and, if possible, extract lessons for the
        future?
      </p>
      <p>
        以往对冷战史的叙述强调两极分化：五十年前历史学家间的正统-修正主义论战中的马克思列宁主义意识形态与俄罗斯民族主义；二十世纪九十年代流亡学者弗拉基斯拉夫·祖博克(Valdislav
        Zubok)和康斯坦丁·普列沙科夫(Constantine
        Pleshakov)提出的革命与帝国主义范式。去中心主义者后来又添加了第三极，将超级大国之间长期和平的相对稳定性与它们代理人之间的持续暴力形成对比。因此，冷战史在这一意义上已经成为三体问题。我们如何开始将它重新整合起来，并可能从中为未来吸取教训呢？
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Theory, Radchenko acknowledges, won’t help: it privileges parsimony as a
        path to predictability but too often confirms what’s obvious while
        oversimplifying what’s not. That leaves, as an alternative, narration.
        But narration requires archives for validation, and access to archives
        seems unlikely in Vladimir Putin’s Russia, a regime not known for
        transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
        理论或许并无助益，拉德琴科承认：它虽推崇简约以达致可预测性，但往往只能确认显而易见之事，同时将复杂问题过度简化。于是，叙事成为另一种选择。但叙事需要档案资料来加以证实，而在弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir
        Putin)领导下的俄罗斯，档案资料似乎不太可能开放，俄政府以不透明著称。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        History, however, is full of surprises. One is what Radchenko describes
        as a “deluge” of Cold War–era documents, released over the past decade,
        from Soviet government and Communist Party archives, as well as from the
        personal papers of Kremlin leaders. Radchenko doesn’t try to explain why
        this has happened; he’s content instead to make the most of the
        opportunity it presents to “know” Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev,
        Gorbachev, and their associates at a “very personal level.” It’s like
        being a “psychological counselor,” he writes, “in a session with a
        client who tells the same stories over and over again to reveal the
        underlying passions and fears.”
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，历史总是充满惊奇。其中一件令拉德琴科感到惊讶的事是：过去十年来，苏联政府和共产党档案，以及克里姆林宫领导人的私人文件，纷纷对外公开，犹如冷战时代的一场“洪水”。拉德琴科并未试图解释这一现象为何发生；他满足于利用这个机会，让我们能“非常私密地”了解斯大林、赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、戈尔巴乔夫及其同僚。“这就像是在做心理咨询，”他写道，“客户一遍遍重复相同的故事，以揭示其深层的情感和恐惧。”

      <h3>HOME AND AWAY</h3>
      <h3>《家和万事兴》</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        So what, from that vantage point, can one learn? Radchenko’s most
        significant finding is how great the gap was between the ideology on
        which the Soviet Union was founded, on the one hand, and the topography
        on which it sought to impose its authority, on the other. “What the
        Soviets saw as their ‘legitimate’ interests,” he writes, “were often not
        seen as particularly ‘legitimate’ by anybody else, leading to a kind of
        ontological insecurity on the Soviet part that was compensated for by
        hubris and aggression.”
      </p>
      <p>
        那么，从这一视角出发，我们可以学到什么呢？拉德琴科最重要的发现是，苏联的意识形态与其试图强加权威的地缘政治之间存在着巨大的鸿沟。“苏联人所认为的‘合理’利益，”他写道，“在其他人看来往往并非如此，这导致了苏联人在本质上感到不安全，因而转而采取傲慢和侵略性的行为来弥补。”

        Take, for example, Joseph Stalin’s simultaneous commitment to world
        revolution and to securing the state he ran. The Soviet Union, he
        believed, deserved a place of honor in international affairs as the
        first nation to have aligned itself with the class struggle, the
        previously hidden driver of modern history. Its security, however,
        required brutalities: agricultural collectivization, indiscriminate
        purges, exorbitant wartime sacrifices. The difficulty here, Radchenko
        points out, is that unilateral imposition secures neither honor nor
        safety: respect, if genuine, can arise only by consent. That left Stalin
        seeking to enhance the Soviet Union’s external reputation without
        compromising its internal safety while maintaining, in both domains, its
        and his own legitimacy. In short, a three-body problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        以约瑟夫·斯大林同时致力于世界革命和维护他所统治的国家为例。他认为，作为第一个投身于现代历史隐藏动力——阶级斗争的国家，苏联在国际事务中理应享有崇高的地位。然而，国家安全需要实施残暴行为：农业集体化、大清洗、战争中的巨大牺牲。拉德琴科指出，这里的问题是，单方面强加既不能带来荣誉，也不能带来安全：如果有的话，只有获得同意才能产生尊重。这使得斯大林既要提升苏联的外部声誉，又要不损害其内部安全，同时在两个领域维持苏联及其自身的合法性。简而言之，这是一个三体问题。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Radchenko defines legitimacy as satisfaction with things as they are,
        and there are various ways of obtaining it. Marlon Brando, in The
        Godfather, spoke softly but left a horse head, when needed, on selected
        bedsheets: offers followed that recipients couldn’t refuse. Stalin was
        capable of such efficiencies, but only within realms he fully
        controlled. Beyond these, his preference was to convene bosses like
        mafia dons dividing up territories—hence his expectation at the World
        War II conferences in Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam that his U.S. and
        British counterparts would acknowledge Soviet authority over half of
        Europe. But Stalin saw this, Radchenko argues, as only a temporary
        arrangement. The Anglo-Americans, being predatory capitalists, would
        soon go to war with one another, Stalin believed, leaving Europeans not
        yet within the Soviet sphere to voluntarily choose communist parties to
        lead them, in close correspondence with Moscow’s wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        合法性在拉季琴科的定义中，意味着对现状的满意，而获得它的手段多种多样。马龙·白兰度在《教父》中轻声细语，但在必要的时候，会在特定人物的床单上留下一匹马的头颅：随后会有无法拒绝的提议。斯大林也能做到这样的效率，但仅限于他完全掌控的领域。除此之外，他就像是黑手党教父一样召集老大们划分地盘——因此，在德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦的二战会议上，他会期待美国和英国同行承认苏联对半个欧洲的权威。但拉季琴科认为，斯大林视之为暂时的安排。他认为，盎格鲁-美国人作为掠夺性的资本家，很快就会自相残杀，这样那些还未进入苏联势力范围的欧洲人就会自愿选择共产党来领导他们，与莫斯科的意愿保持一致。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        When that didn’t happen—when Moscow’s legitimacy beyond Stalin’s
        authority failed to take root—he had only improvisation to fall back on:
        indecisiveness in responding to the Marshall Plan, a Czechoslovak coup
        that alarmed more than intimidated those who witnessed it, an
        unsuccessful blockade of Berlin from which he had to back down, and a
        botched campaign to displace Tito’s communist regime in Yugoslavia, the
        only one in Europe with homegrown legitimacy. That’s how the Soviet
        leader earned an honor he wouldn’t have wanted: he, more than anyone
        else, deserves recognition for having founded NATO in 1949. Legitimacy
        was the wild card, the disrupter, the third sun in the Stalinist Cold
        War firmament.
      </p>
      <p>
        斯大林的继任者们没能复制这一合法性——莫斯科的权威未能超出他的个人威望——他们只能依靠即兴发挥：对马歇尔计划的犹豫不决，对捷克斯洛伐克的政变草率出手，这场政变吓到了目击者，却未能令他们屈服；柏林封锁的失败以及试图推翻铁托在南斯拉夫建立的、拥有本土合法性的共产主义政权的拙劣行动。这些就是苏联领导人赢得一个他并不想要的荣誉的方式：他是建立北约的头号功臣，而北约于1949年成立。合法性是未知因素，是搅局者，是斯大林时代冷战天穹中的第三颗太阳。

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Stalin, a Europeanist, had no plans, Radchenko emphasizes, for “turning
        the world red.” Nikita Khrushchev was more ambitious. “National
        liberation” movements in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East would, he
        thought, look to the Soviet Union for leadership, if it could free
        itself from Stalinist repression while achieving more rapid economic
        development than capitalism had so far accomplished. Meanwhile, Mao
        Zedong’s establishment of a “people’s republic” in China more than
        compensated for communism’s setbacks in central and western Europe.
        Khrushchev wasn’t content, however, with these favorable portents. He
        wanted to speed things up, and that made him personally, in pursuit of
        his particular vision of legitimacy, his own wild card.
      </p>
      <p>
        斯大林是个欧洲主义者，拉德琴科强调，他并无“染红世界”的计划。尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫则雄心勃勃。他认为，如果苏联能够在摆脱斯大林压迫的同时实现比资本主义迄今为止更快的经济发展，“非洲、亚洲和中东的民族解放运动”就会寻求苏联的领导。与此同时，毛泽东在中国建立“人民共和国”，在一定程度上抵消了共产主义在中西欧遭受的挫折。然而，赫鲁晓夫并不满足于这些好兆头。他希望加快速度，而这使他在追求自己特定合法性愿景的过程中，成为了一张不可预测的牌。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Khrushchev began the process with his 1956 “secret speech” denouncing
        Stalin to the 20th Party Congress. Because he’d failed to prepare anyone
        for it, the address became a “wound-up spring”—Radchenko’s apt
        characterization—which, when released, caused consternation at home;
        revolts in Poland and Hungary; disillusionment among French, Italian,
        and even Scandinavian communists; and deep distrust within the mind of
        Mao, who had only begun, with Stalin safely dead, to regard him as a
        role model. International communism did indeed go global, but in such a
        manner as to immediately fragment itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        赫鲁晓夫在1956年针对斯大林的“秘密报告”拉开了这一进程的序幕，他在第二十次党代会上谴责了斯大林。由于事先没有做任何铺垫，这个报告成了雷琴科所形容的“上了发条的钟”——一经释放，就在国内引起恐慌；在波兰和匈牙利引发起义；令法国、意大利甚至斯堪的纳维亚的共产党人感到幻灭；并深深刺痛了毛泽东的心，他原本刚刚开始将斯大林当作榜样来崇拜，此时斯大林已经安全地死去。国际共产主义确实走向了全球化，但却以一种立即导致自身分裂的方式。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The successful Sputnik satellite launch of 1957 might have reversed
        these losses had Khrushchev not tried to make it a panacea. If the
        Soviet Union could send satellites into orbit, he reasoned, then why not
        refrigerators into kitchens? Why shouldn’t a socialist planned economy
        outproduce capitalist rivals in all respects?
      </p>
      <p>
        1957年苏联成功发射人造卫星本来可以扭转这种颓势，但赫鲁晓夫却试图将此事一劳永逸地作为灵丹妙药。他心想，既然苏联能把卫星送入轨道，为什么不能把冰箱送入厨房呢？既然苏联建立了社会主义计划经济，为什么不能在所有方面都超过资本主义竞争对手呢？
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Few goods of any kind appeared in communist households, however, a
        disappointment especially evident in East Germany, within which the
        postwar settlement had left the conspicuous capitalist enclave of West
        Berlin. Khrushchev tried resolving the situation with rockets: he would
        terminate Western rights in the city and enforce the restriction with
        threats of nuclear war. American spy planes and satellite photography,
        however, revealed that the Soviet military had not produced missiles
        “like sausages” as Khrushchev had unwisely bragged.
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，共产国家的百姓家里却几乎看不到什么像样的东西，这一点在东德尤其明显，因为战后格局中西柏林这个资本主义飞地就设在东德境内。赫鲁晓夫试图用火箭来解决这个问题：他将终结西方在该市的权利，并以核战争的威胁来强制执行这一决定。然而，美国间谍飞机和卫星照片显示，苏联军队并没有像赫鲁晓夫轻率吹嘘的那样“大批量生产导弹”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        With his bluff called, Khrushchev allowed the East Germans the
        humiliation of a wall around West Berlin, then authorized the
        atmospheric test of an unusably gigantic thermonuclear bomb, and finally
        quietly—but not quietly enough—dispatched missiles armed with nuclear
        warheads to Fidel Castro’s Cuba, the only communist outpost in the
        Western Hemisphere, all in an effort to regain global respect by
        threatening global annihilation. Fed up with such risk-taking,
        Khrushchev’s Kremlin colleagues deposed him in October 1964, leaving
        Leonid Brezhnev to gradually consolidate the power he would hold longer
        than any Soviet leader apart from Stalin himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        赫鲁晓夫先是让东德政府蒙羞，允许它在西柏林四周筑起一道围墙，接着又批准进行一次规模空前、实际上无法使用的热核武器大气层试验，最后悄悄地——但没有足够保密地——将携带核弹头的导弹运往卡斯特罗的古巴，古巴是西半球唯一的共产主义前哨。他试图通过威胁全球毁灭来重获国际尊重，但他的那些克里姆林宫同僚对此已忍无可忍，于是在1964年10月把他赶下了台。勃列日涅夫随后逐步巩固了自己的权力，其掌权时间仅次于斯大林。

      <h3>LEGITIMACY AND ITS DISCONTENTS</h3>
      <h3>合法性及其不满</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Brezhnev was stolid, soothing, and, until his health began to fail in
        the mid-1970s, reassuringly steady. That has faded him for most
        historians, who prefer writing about more colorful characters, but hints
        of revisionism have begun to appear: Zubok’s 2007 book, A Failed Empire:
        The Soviet Union in the Cold War From Stalin to Gorbachev, gives
        Brezhnev almost the status of U.S. President Richard Nixon, U.S.
        Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and West German Chancellor Willy
        Brandt as an architect of détente. How, though, could such an implied
        acceptance of international stability coexist with the expectation,
        which Brezhnev never repudiated, that “proletarians” in all countries
        would eventually rise up?
      </p>
      <p>
        勃列日涅夫沉着稳重，给人以安心之感，直到1970年代中期他的健康开始恶化。这使他在多数历史学家的笔下相形见绌——他们更喜欢描写一些性格鲜明的人物——但现在，对他的评价已有修正：祖博克2007年的著作《失败的帝国：从斯大林到戈尔巴乔夫的冷战中的苏联》中，将勃列日涅夫与美国总统理查德·尼克松、国务卿亨利·基辛格及西德总理维利·勃兰特并列，视为缓和政策的建筑师。然而，这种对国际稳定的隐含接受，怎能与勃列日涅夫从未放弃的信念——全世界无产者最终会站起来——并存呢？
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Through sharing legitimacies, Radchenko suggests, the most important of
        which was that the superpowers both feared a nuclear apocalypse. The
        Cold War didn’t end history, but it did remove whatever benefits might
        have remained in fighting another world war. Despite an overwhelming
        U.S. advantage in nuclear weapons at the time of the Cuban missile
        crisis, neither side was willing to risk using them against the other.
        Brezhnev’s role, through the rest of the 1960s, was to replace
        Khrushchev’s bluffs with actual capabilities, thereby creating a balance
        in strategic weaponry that made possible the arms limitation agreements
        of the 1970s. Quests for legitimacy, in this instance, converged
        compatibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        通过分享正当性——其中最重要的是，两个超级大国都害怕核末日——冷战并没有终结历史，但却消除了再次爆发世界大战可能带来的任何好处。尽管在古巴导弹危机时美国在核武器上占据压倒性优势，但双方都不愿冒险对对方使用核武器。在随后的整个10年里，勃列日涅夫通过增强实力，替换了赫鲁晓夫的虚张声势，从而在战略武器上达到了均衡，这使得在1970年代能够签署军控协议。在这种情况下，追求正当性的努力是相向而行的。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A second convergence had to do with the demarcation of boundaries: Cold
        War competition would continue in some areas, but not in others.
        Brezhnev made it clear that the Soviet Union would still support “wars
        of national liberation” in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, while the
        Americans, less explicitly, committed themselves to waging what might be
        called “wars of containment” in those same regions. Meanwhile, the
        status quo that divided Europe would remain in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        第二个共识涉及划分界限：冷战竞争将继续在某些领域进行，但不在其他领域。勃列日涅夫明确表示，苏联仍会支持非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的“民族解放战争”，而美国则不那么明确地承诺，在这些地区打一场可以叫做“遏制战争”的仗。与此同时，欧洲的现状将维持不变。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A third priority, for Brezhnev, was personal diplomacy. Khrushchev
        relished the recognition that came with his 1959 visit to the United
        States, but neither he nor Stalin tried to build long-term relationships
        with American or other Western leaders. Brezhnev, however, pursued Nixon
        almost as relentlessly as a stalker does a star, even as the president
        escalated military operations in Vietnam in 1972 and then sank into the
        Watergate swamps of 1973–74. Images of the two relaxing at Nixon’s San
        Clemente residence, admiring the Pacific while in shirtsleeves with feet
        propped up and drinks within reach, were a high point for Brezhnev, if
        not for the international proletarian revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        勃列日涅夫的第三个优先考虑是个人外交。赫鲁晓夫很享受1959年访美时受到的礼遇，但他和斯大林都没想过要跟美国或其他西方国家领导人建立长期关系。然而，勃列日涅夫对尼克松的追求简直像狂热分子追星一样，即使在1972年尼克松升级越南战争，以及在1973至1974年间深陷水门事件泥潭时也不例外。两人在尼克松位于圣克利门蒂的住所中轻松对酌、赤膊倚坐、脚搭扶手、面朝太平洋的照片，对勃列日涅夫来说是其个人外交的一大亮点，尽管这对国际无产阶级革命并无多大助益。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        And yet legitimacies, Radchenko shows, could be a double-edged sword.
        Demarcations didn’t always diminish temptations, as when Nixon and
        Kissinger forced the Soviets out of the Middle East after the 1973 Yom
        Kippur War, or when Brezhnev took advantage, two years later, of the
        Americans’ defeat in Vietnam to expand Soviet activities in eastern and
        southern Africa. Third parties could upset equilibriums by switching
        sides, as the Chinese spectacularly did when they welcomed Nixon to
        Beijing in 1972, or by shaming superpower patrons for insufficient
        militancy, a proficiency the Cubans deployed against the Soviets in
        Africa in the years that followed.

        但合法性也是一把双刃剑。国界划定并不总能减少诱惑，比如在1973年赎罪日战争后，尼克松和基辛格迫使苏联退出中东，或者在两年后勃列日涅夫利用美国在越南的失败加强对东非和南非的活动。第三方可以通过倒戈来打破均势，如中国在1972年欢迎尼克松访华时那样；或通过谴责超级大国对激进主义不够热心来破坏现状，这正是古巴在随后几年中在非洲针对苏联所做的事情。

        Leadership, too, posed legitimacy problems. Presidential campaigns
        became permanent in the United States after Watergate, leaving little
        time and too much visibility for reflections, rectifications, and
        reassessments. Meanwhile, the absence of criticism and hence
        accountability in the Soviet Union required keeping Brezhnev in power
        until the day he died, a process hardly conducive to agility or
        adaptivity. These difficulties opened the way for Ronald Reagan, in his
        1980 presidential campaign and during his first years in office, to
        question the legitimacy of the Cold War itself: if the purpose of
        détente had been not to end that conflict but to institutionalize it,
        was that the best that the competitors could do?
      </p>
      <p>
        领导层的合法性也成问题。水门事件后,美国总统竞选变成了一种常态,几乎没有时间进行反省、纠错和重新评估。与此同时,苏联不允许批评,因此也就没有问责制,勃列日涅夫一直掌权直至去世,这个过程导致苏联体制僵化,无法适应变化。这些困难为罗纳德·里根在1980年总统大选期间及上任初期质疑冷战本身的合法性铺平了道路:如果缓和的目的是不是终结这场冲突,而是使它制度化,那么竞争对手是否就只能做到这一步了?

        That brings Radchenko to the last Soviet leader, who so suspended
        himself between legitimacies that the end of his career coincided with
        the end of his country. Mikhail Gorbachev set out to reform his regime
        in such a way as to convince Europeans to welcome its membership among
        them, Americans to regard it as a partner in securing world order, and
        the world itself to acknowledge his own personal preeminence as, in
        Radchenko’s words, “strategist-in-chief for change.”
      </p>
      <p>
        这让雷德琴科得以讨论最后一位苏联领导人，他把自己悬挂在各种合法性之间，以至于他的职业生涯的终结与国家的终结同步。戈尔巴乔夫起初试图改革体制，以说服欧洲人接纳它，说服美国人视其为维护世界秩序的伙伴，并让全世界都承认他是“变革总设计师”。

    </div>
    <div>

        The first whiffs of perestroika, however, set off a “dash for the West”
        among former Soviet satellites, which saw far more clearly than
        Gorbachev that fulfilling his mission would mean their liberation. That
        withholding of legitimacy in his own neighborhood denied Gorbachev the
        much wider legitimacy he had hoped to obtain. Witnessing this, the
        non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union saw no reason themselves to
        remain within it, as ultimately, under Boris Yeltsin, did the Russian
        republic itself. Having delegitimized himself on all fronts, Gorbachev
        wound up, Radchenko somewhat rudely reminds us, making a Pizza Hut
        commercial in 1997. To be fair, he was the only Nobel Peace Prize winner
        to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        但戈尔巴乔夫改革的最初征兆却引发了东欧前卫星国的“向西冲刺”，它们比戈尔巴乔夫更清楚地意识到，完成他的使命意味着自身的解放。戈尔巴乔夫在自家后院遭到的拒绝令他无法获得原本希望得到的更广泛合法性。苏联的非俄罗斯加盟共和国目睹了这一切，它们没有理由继续留在苏联之内，俄罗斯最终也在鲍里斯·叶利钦领导下走了这条路。戈尔巴乔夫最终在各个方面都丧失了合法性，拉德琴科略显粗鲁地提醒我们，他在1997年为必胜客拍摄了广告。平心而论，他是唯一这么做的诺贝尔和平奖得主。

        So is To Run the World, as Radchenko acknowledges in his introduction,
        “dangerously thin on theory”? For anyone in search of clockwork
        predictability, the answer is surely yes. But if one seeks patterns—the
        recognition of similarities across time, space, and scale—then this book
        has the potential to significantly revise not only how historians think
        about the Soviet Union but also the much longer sweep of Russian history
        that has now unexpectedly produced, in Putin, a new tsar.
      </p>
      <p>
        那么，如拉德琴科在序言中承认的那样，《统治世界》在理论方面是否“太过单薄”呢？对于那些寻找机械式可预测性的人来说，答案无疑是肯定的。但如果你寻找的是模式——即跨越时间、空间和规模的相似性——那么此书有可能不仅会改变历史学家对苏联的看法，还会改变他们对俄罗斯史更长时段的解读。如今，俄罗斯出人意料地在普京身上再现了沙皇。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        For what Putin appears to want is a new legitimacy based on much older
        ones: not the ideological rigidities of Marxism-Leninism, but the
        murkier and more malleable legacies of tsarist imperialism, Russian
        nationalism, and an almost medieval religious orthodoxy. Where the
        Soviet Union fits within this frame—a post-Soviet history that echoes
        pre-Soviet history—remains to be determined, but by emphasizing
        legitimacy, Radchenko has pointed the way. “The sources of Soviet
        ambitions,” he concludes, “are not specifically Soviet but both precede
        and postdate the Soviet Union.” Putin’s ambitions aren’t likely to be
        much different.
      </p>
      <p>
        普京似乎想要的是一种建立在更古老传统之上的新合法性：不是马列主义的教条，而是沙皇帝国主义、俄罗斯民族主义以及一种几乎中世纪般的宗教正统的更加模糊且多变的遗产。苏联在这幅图景中的地位——一种回响着苏联之前历史的后苏联历史——还有待确定，但拉德琴科强调合法性为思考这个问题指明了方向。“苏联野心的根源，”他总结道，“并非苏联独有，而是在苏联之前和之后都存在。”普汀的野心恐怕也不会有多大不同。

        Radchenko’s book challenges, as well, the study of grand strategy. That
        field has long loved binaries: ends versus means, aspirations versus
        capabilities, planning versus improvisation, hopes versus fears, even
        foxes versus hedgehogs. The unofficial motto of the Yale Grand Strategy
        program has long been F. Scott Fitzgerald’s claim that the sign of a
        first-rate intelligence is “the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the
        mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” But
        what if it’s three?
      </p>
      <p>
        拉德琴科还对宏大战略研究提出了挑战。这一领域长久以来热衷于两分法：目标与手段，志向与能力，规划与即兴，希望与恐惧，甚至狐狸与刺猬。耶鲁大学宏大战略课程的非官方座右铭长期以来都是F·斯科特·菲茨杰拉德的论断，他认为一流智慧的标志是“能够在脑海中同时持有两种相反的想法，同时仍保持行动的能力”。但如果有三种呢？
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        What Radchenko shows is that the demands of revolution, security, and
        legitimacy were equally compelling for Soviet leaders during the Cold
        War. The first two they could balance with roughly predictable results,
        but not the third. For it lay beyond their remit: the “strong” were not
        always able to do what they wanted, to paraphrase Thucydides, and the
        “weak” found many ways to resist instruction, thereby retaining the
        right to decide things for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        如果说拉德琴科的书证明了什么，那就是在冷战期间，对苏联领导人来说，革命、安全和合法性的要求同样紧迫。前两者他们还能大致平衡，但后者则不然。因为合法性超出了他们的权限：“强者并不总是能够为所欲为”，套用修昔底德的话，而“弱者”找到了许多抵制命令的方法，从而保留下了自行决定事务的权利。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Should we conclude from this, then, that autocracies find retaining
        legitimacy more difficult than do democracies? It would be reassuring to
        think so, were it not for the particular questions lodged, like
        malevolent matryoshka dolls, within this larger one. How was it that
        ancient Athens, arguably the world’s first democracy, turned out to be
        its last for the next two millennia? Why did the American founders see
        themselves as establishing not a democracy but a republican empire?
        Didn’t the Americans, during the century named for them, also have, like
        the Soviet Union, an ideology they sought to export? How many recipients
        of instructions given then respect them now? And finally, do political
        processes within the United States reliably produce agile, adaptive
        leadership?
      </p>
      <p>
        据此，我们是否可以认为，威权政体比民主政体更难维持合法性呢？如果这个问题不伴随着一连串更微妙的问题，这样的结论倒是令人宽慰的：为什么古代雅典——这个可能是世界上第一个民主国家——在接下来的两千年里竟成了最后一个？美国的建国者们为何认为他们建立的不是一个民主国家，而是一个共和国帝国？在那个以美国命名的世纪里，美国人不也像苏联一样，有一种意识形态要输出吗？当年那些指令的接受者当中，现在还有多少人尊重那些指令呢？最后，美国的政治程序能否确保产生灵活、适应力强的领导层呢？

        Good books, whatever their subject, provide mirrors in which we see
        ourselves, often with disconcerting results. To Run the World more than
        meets that standard. It’s not just a major reconsideration of Cold War
        history but also an admonition to any country—or to any ruler of a
        country—foolish enough to try turning its title into an agenda for
        action.
      </p>
      <p>
        好书不管论及何种主题都能提供一面镜子，让我们看清自己，而结果往往令人不安。《操控世界》一书不仅达到了这一标准，而且有更高的追求：它不仅是对冷战史的重新思考，也对任何试图将书名作为行动纲领的国家或领导人提出了警告。
