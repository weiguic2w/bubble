        After more than 20 years of costly military adventures, the United
        States has failed to root out extremism or bring liberal democracy to
        the oppressed. Thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives in
        the failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond—and the death toll
        among civilians is in the millions. In the wake of these calamities,
        progressives have united around an overriding foreign policy
        prescription: the United States should jettison its world-dominating
        ambitions, restrain itself from taking on new commitments, and retrench
        from the world, shrinking the U.S. military’s footprint. In think tanks
        and universities, progressives are calling on Washington to avoid what
        they view as belligerent policies toward China and Russia. In Congress,
        the Progressive Caucus—the most left-leaning faction of the Democratic
        Party—has hesitated over U.S. support for Ukraine and opposed a U.S.
        military presence in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
        历经20多年代价高昂的军事冒险后，美国未能根除极端主义，也未给受压迫者带来自由民主。成千上万的美国士兵在阿富汗、伊拉克以及其他地方的失败战争中失去生命，而平民的死亡人数则以百万计。在这场灾难之后，进步派在一项压倒性的外交政策处方上达成了一致：美国应该放弃其主宰世界的野心，克制自己不承担新的承诺，并从世界抽身，缩减美国军事存在。在智库和大学里，进步派呼吁华盛顿避免他们眼中对华和对俄的挑衅性政策。在国会，进步党团——民主党中最左翼的派系——对美国对乌克兰的支持犹豫不决，并反对美国在叙利亚的军事存在。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The trouble with this new consensus, however, is that Washington is not
        operating in a vacuum. An undeviating policy of U.S. restraint risks
        giving free rein to decidedly regressive forces in the world—such as
        China’s authoritarian influence across the global South, Iran’s
        financing of terrorism in the Middle East, and Russia’s war of
        aggression against Ukraine. Progressives are right to have a healthy
        skepticism of using military force and coercive power. But the reality
        today is that there are authoritarian powers that are repressing their
        own populations, bullying neighboring states, and wielding economic
        influence and military force in other ways that are antithetical to
        progressive values. If the United States retrenched, the world would
        surely see more such behavior, not less.
      </p>
      <p>
        但这一新共识的问题在于，美国并非在真空中行动。毫不妥协的美国克制政策有可能放任世界各地明显倒行逆施的力量——比如中国在广大发展中国家的威权主义影响、伊朗对中东恐怖主义的资金支持以及俄罗斯对乌克兰的侵略战争。进步派对使用军事力量和强制手段抱有健康的怀疑态度，这是正确的。但现实是，如今存在一些威权国家，它们压迫本国人民，欺凌邻国，并以与进步价值观背道而驰的方式运用经济影响力和军事力量。如果美国撤退，世人看到的这类行为只会更多，不会更少。

        Today’s progressives need to get comfortable with American power, which,
        for all its flaws, has a crucial role to play. That doesn’t mean
        condoning illiberal actions to achieve just ends or cynically invoking
        progressive ideals to justify military adventurism. But it does mean
        seeking to harness power to advance the values progressives cherish—and
        accepting that might sometimes makes right.
      </p>
      <p>
        今天的自由主义者需要接受美国的强权，尽管它有种种缺陷，但在可预见的未来，它将继续发挥关键作用。这并不意味着为达到正义目的而姑息不民主行为，或玩世不恭地以进步理念为军事冒险主义正名。但这确实意味着，要运用强权推进自由主义者珍视的价值观——并承认实力有时即是公理。

      <h3>PILLARS OF PROGRESSIVISM</h3>
      <h3>进步主义的支柱</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A progressive foreign policy shares some features with other approaches
        but stands apart in key ways. Liberal internationalism, a foreign policy
        that aims to spread and protect liberal economic and political values,
        seeks to promote democracy and undermine authoritarianism. So does
        conservative primacy, which calls for the United States to maintain the
        preponderance of global power. But compared with progressivism, these
        doctrines are more optimistic about the ability of military force to
        achieve its goals, and they are less committed to opposing imperialism
        and encouraging self-determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        进步主义外交政策与其他几种政策有一些共同之处，但也有一些关键区别。自由国际主义的外交政策旨在传播和保护自由经济与政治价值观，它希望建立民主，打击威权主义。主张美国应维持全球霸权地位的保守至上主义亦是如此。但与进步主义相比，这些学说更加乐观地认为军事力量能够实现其目标，而且它们在反对帝国主义、支持自决权方面态度不那么坚决。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Progressive foreign policy also has some similarities to deep
        engagement, an approach that demands the buildup of a military arsenal
        sufficient to deter attacks against not only the United States but also
        its allies. Proponents of both progressivism and deep engagement want
        Washington to work with allies through multilateral institutions such as
        the UN. But progressives go further, championing significant changes to
        these institutions, with an eye to making them more equitable rather
        than necessarily U.S.-led. Progressives are also more willing to hold
        back military aid from allies—as when the Biden administration paused a
        shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May over growing concerns
        about the civilian death toll in Gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
        进步主义外交政策在一些方面也类似于深陷其中的外交政策，即要求建立足以威慑对美国及其盟友的攻击的军火库。进步主义者和深陷其中的外交政策的支持者都希望华盛顿能与盟友通过联合国等多边机构合作。但进步主义者更进一步，他们呼吁对这些机构进行重大改革，目的是让它们变得更加公平，而不是一定要由美国领导。进步主义者也更愿意在对盟友实施军事援助时保持克制——比如拜登政府今年5月因担心加沙平民死亡人数不断增加而暂停了向以色列运送2000磅炸弹。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        On domestic policy, progressives mostly agree on specific priorities:
        higher taxes for the rich, more spending on social programs, legal
        protections for abortion, reforms to address the legacy of racism, and
        so on. But there is far less consensus on foreign policy; instead, there
        is a more general agreement on certain values that should inform U.S.
        foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        在内政方面，进步派在一些具体优先事项上大致取得一致：对富人增税、增加社会项目支出、保护堕胎合法权利、采取措施解决种族主义遗留问题等等。但在外交政策方面，共识要少得多；取而代之的是对外交政策应秉持的价值观有更广泛的一致。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The first is political and economic egalitarianism. This value can be
        furthered through policies that promote equal political rights and
        economic opportunities for women and other marginalized people, enforce
        strong labor and environmental protections in trade agreements, and
        condition military aid on human rights conditions. Just as progressives
        support domestic policies that advance such goals at home, they champion
        similar policies abroad. The platform of Democratic Senator Bernie
        Sanders, for example, calls for “a foreign policy which focuses on
        democracy, human rights, diplomacy and peace, and economic fairness.”
      </p>
      <p>
        第一是政治和经济的平等主义。这需要通过推动赋予妇女和其他被边缘化的群体平等的政治权利和经济机会、在贸易协议中实施强有力的劳工和环境保护措施、以及将人权标准作为军事援助的条件等政策来实现。正如进步主义者在国内支持能推动这些目标的政策一样，他们也主张类似的国际政策。例如，参议员伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie
        Sanders)的民主党竞选纲领呼吁“一个注重民主、人权、外交和和平以及经济公平的外交政策”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The second principle fundamental to progressive thought is opposition to
        needless war and excessive militarism, a tenet often described as
        restraint. Progressives generally want Washington to avoid the use of
        force and instead resolve disputes through talks. They are skeptical of
        military alliances, which they argue can antagonize rivals and imperil
        other states. “There are significant drawbacks to NATO’s continuing
        existence,” the progressive historian Daniel Bessner has argued. “For
        this reason, one of the major goals of the anti-imperialist left should
        be to dismantle NATO.” Some progressive advocates of restraint, such as
        the economist Jeffrey Sachs and the historian Stephen Wertheim, view
        NATO enlargement as one of the primary causes of Russia’s invasion of
        Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
        进步思想的第二个基本原则是反对不必要的战争和过度的军国主义，这一原则通常被称为克制。进步人士普遍希望华盛顿避免使用武力，而是通过谈判解决争端。他们对军事联盟持怀疑态度，认为这可能会激怒对手，危及其他国家。进步派历史学家丹尼尔·贝斯纳(Daniel
        Bessner)认为，“北约的继续存在存在重大缺陷。”“出于这个原因，反帝国主义左翼的主要目标之一应该是解散北约。”一些主张克制的进步人士，如经济学家杰弗里·萨克斯(Jeffrey
        Sachs)和历史学家斯蒂芬·韦特海姆(Stephen
        Wertheim)，认为北约东扩是俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的主要原因之一。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The third principle is anti-imperialism, which emerged as a pillar of
        leftist and progressive thought in the late nineteenth century as a
        reaction against European empire building. To be sure, not every
        progressive saw colonialism as problematic—U.S. President Theodore
        Roosevelt chief among them. But by the turn of the twentieth century,
        many progressives had begun to criticize the colonial projects of
        France, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. Later, as
        anticolonial movements took root beginning in the postwar era, Western
        anti-imperialist activists, including many in the civil rights movement
        and the anti-apartheid movement, often supported independence struggles
        by sending financial resources to national liberation movements and
        publicizing their struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
        第三条原则是反帝国主义，它在19世纪末作为左翼和进步思想的支柱出现，是对欧洲帝国建设的反应。诚然，并非所有进步人士都认为殖民主义存在问题——美国前总统西奥多·罗斯福就是其中的典型代表。但到了20世纪之交，许多进步人士开始批评法国、英国和其他欧洲国家的殖民计划。后来，在战后时期，随着反殖民运动的兴起，西方反帝国主义活动人士——包括民权运动和反种族隔离运动的很多人——常常通过向民族解放运动提供资金并宣传其斗争来支持争取独立的斗争。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Even today, Western commentators sometimes invoke anti-imperialism in
        their calls for international solidarity, as when they argue in favor of
        supporting Ukrainians’ effort to resist Russia’s imperialist aggression.
        More often, however, contemporary anti-imperialism in the West is
        inwardly focused, manifested in calls to combat Western policies and
        practices that perpetuate systems of domination and exploitation over
        poor countries. Progressives worry about Western companies’ behavior in
        the developing world, such as their use of cheap labor, land
        expropriation, and environmental degradation. They worry, too, about
        Western governments’ imperialist treatment of other countries, as with
        the imposition of “Washington consensus” economic reforms in Latin
        America.
      </p>
      <p>
        时至今日，西方评论员有时仍会打出反帝国主义的旗号，呼吁国际团结，例如呼吁支持乌克兰抵抗俄罗斯帝国主义侵略。然而，西方现时的反帝国主义更多地表现为向内看，体现在对打击西方自身那些延续对贫困国家统治和剥削政策的呼吁中。进步人士对西方企业的发展中国家行为感到忧虑，比如使用廉价劳动力、强征土地和破坏环境。他们也对西方政府对待其他国家的帝国主义行径感到忧虑，比如在拉丁美洲推行“华盛顿共识”经济改革。

      <h3>WHO’S TO BLAME?</h3>
      <h3>该由谁负责？</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        For many progressives, these three principles are best pursued through a
        foreign policy of retrenchment and restraint, since, in their view, it
        is the United States that is to blame for much of what ails the world
        today. The political scientist Van Jackson describes “anti-hegemonism”
        as a branch of progressive grand strategy that “prioritizes restraining
        U.S. military and economic power because it is the only adequate
        response to the perceived root cause of global insecurity.” Bessner
        would also like to see Washington “restrain and reduce” its power. In
        this vision, the United States would have fewer military bases, less
        influence on global economic markets, and fewer and weaker military
        alliances. It would shy away from getting involved in foreign crises,
        especially those requiring military commitments, such as the war in
        Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
        在很多进步人士看来，这三大目标最好通过一种紧缩和克制的外交政策来实现，因为他们认为美国要为当今世界的很多问题负责。政治学家范·杰克逊(Van
        Jackson)将“反对霸权”称作进步主义总体战略的一个分支，它“优先考虑限制美国的军事和经济实力，因为这是对全球不安全根源的唯一适当回应”。贝斯纳也希望看到华盛顿“克制并减少”其影响力。按照这一设想，美国将拥有更少的海外基地，对全球经济市场的影响力较小，军事联盟较少且较为松散。它会避免介入外国危机，尤其是那些需要军事承诺的危机，比如乌克兰战争。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A United States like that, the logic goes, would no longer entangle
        itself in conflicts akin to the “forever wars” that followed 9/11. By
        shrinking its global military footprint, moreover, the country would not
        be able to spread democracy at gunpoint or forcibly promote its
        particular version of hard-edged capitalism, creating more space for
        political and economic self-determination and progress toward political
        and economic egalitarianism. And because the United States is an empire,
        its pulling back would be anti-imperialist almost by definition.
        Progressives take it as a given that retrenchment would not undermine
        their foreign policy goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        照此类推，这样一个美国将不再让自己卷入类似于2001年“9·11”事件后那样的无休止战争。此外，通过缩小全球军事存在，美国将无法再用枪炮推行民主，或强行推广自己那种强硬资本主义模式，从而为政治和经济自决以及向政治和经济平等迈进创造更多空间。由于美国是一个帝国，它的撤退几乎可以自然而然地被定义为反帝国主义。进步派理所当然地认为，战略收缩不会损害他们的外交政策目标。
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3>UNRESOLVABLE TENSIONS</h3>
      <h3>无法化解的紧张局势</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Progressive foreign policy principles—anti-militarism, anti-imperialism,
        and egalitarianism—often conflict. Sometimes, the pursuit of one
        undermines the others. Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in Ukraine.
        In October 2022, the Congressional Progressive Caucus called on the
        Biden administration to negotiate with Russia to end the war, only to
        drop the position under pressure from other Democrats who concluded that
        opposition to imperialism should take precedence over opposition to war.
        Not all progressives agreed with the caucus’s about-face. The historian
        Samuel Moyn has described support for Ukraine as an aspect of “the
        militarization of the globe under U.S. auspices.” Days after the
        invasion, the Democratic Socialists of America, the country’s largest
        socialist organization, called on the United States “to withdraw from
        NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set the stage for this
        conflict.” But if Washington discontinued its military support for
        Ukraine, progressive aims and values in Europe and beyond would almost
        certainly be set back. A strict antimilitarist policy would not serve
        the cause of Ukrainian liberals, who would face a direct threat of
        repression, detention, or even death under Moscow’s ruthless rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        进步的外交政策原则——反军国主义、反帝国主义和平等主义——常常相互冲突，有时追求一个会损害其他原则。这一点在乌克兰问题上表现得尤为明显。2022年10月，国会进步派议员呼吁拜登政府与俄罗斯谈判以结束战争，但在其他民主党人认为反对帝国主义应优先于反对战争的压力下，这一立场很快就放弃了。并非所有进步派都同意该核心小组的立场大转弯。历史学家萨缪尔·莫伊恩(Samuel
        Moyn)将支持乌克兰视为“在美国主导下全球军事化的方面”。入侵几天后，美国最大社会主义组织民主社会主义者(Democratic
        Socialists of
        America)呼吁美国“退出北约，结束导致这场冲突的帝国主义扩张”。然而，如果华盛顿停止对乌克兰的军事支持，欧洲乃至更广泛的地区的进步目标和价值观几乎肯定会被打乱。严格的反军国主义政策不会有利于乌克兰自由主义者，他们将面临来自莫斯科残酷统治下的直接镇压、拘禁甚至死亡威胁。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Retrenchment cannot resolve this tension between, on the one hand,
        opposing war and, on the other, defending egalitarianism and resisting
        imperialism. In fact, abandoning Ukraine wouldn’t necessarily result in
        less war; it could very well embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin
        to intensify his efforts to subjugate the Ukrainian people. And even if
        reducing military aid to Ukraine hastened a formal end to the war
        through peace negotiations, as some progressives hope, violence against
        Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces in occupied territories would
        probably continue apace. It might even escalate.
      </p>
      <p>
        削减开支无法调和反对战争与捍卫平等主义、抵制帝国主义之间的紧张关系。事实上，弃乌克兰于不顾未必就能减少战争；这反而可能会鼓励俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir
        Putin)加大努力，奴役乌克兰人民。即便减少对乌军事援助能够如一些进步人士所愿，通过和平谈判加速正式结束这场战争，俄罗斯军队在占领区对平民的暴力行为也可能继续，甚至可能升级。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A similar tension arises in Syria policy. Some progressive Democrats in
        the House of Representatives, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Becca
        Balint, have joined isolationist Republicans in calling on Washington to
        bring home the 900 U.S. troops still deployed in Syria. These troops
        work alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces, a predominantly Kurdish
        alliance of rebel groups opposed to the regime of Syrian President
        Bashar al-Assad, helping combat the remnants of the Islamic State, or
        ISIS. The SDF was a crucial ally in the U.S.-led coalition to defeat
        ISIS; it governs part of northeast Syria as a de facto state with a
        constitution-like charter that reflects a commitment to democracy, human
        rights, and gender equality.
      </p>
      <p>
        叙利亚政策也出现了类似的紧张态势。众议院的一些进步民主党人，如亚历山大·奥卡西奥-科特兹（Alexandria
        Ocasio-Cortez）和贝卡·巴林特（Becca
        Balint），已与孤立主义共和党人一道呼吁华盛顿撤回仍在叙利亚部署的900名美军。这些美军与叙利亚民主力量（Syrian
        Democratic Forces,
        SDF）并肩作战，后者是一个主要由库尔德人组成的反对叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德（Bashar
        al-Assad）政权的叛军联盟，正在帮助打击伊斯兰国（ISIS）残余势力。SDF是打败ISIS的美国领导的联盟的关键盟友；它以事实上的国家身份治理着叙东北部的一部分地区，有一部类似宪法的章程，体现了对民主、人权和性别平等的承诺。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The presence of U.S. troops is crucial to the SDF’s efforts to maintain
        security in northeast Syria, and the SDF has in fact repeatedly
        expressed concerns that an American withdrawal would be catastrophic. By
        dialing back its modest support of the relatively progressive SDF, the
        United States would enable Iran, Russia, and ISIS to expand their
        influence in Syria and foil one of the region’s few democratic
        independence movements. A complete withdrawal from Syria would be even
        worse, creating a security vacuum in which these forces could pursue
        their violent, antidemocratic agendas. The same goes for Iraq, which
        still hosts 2,500 U.S. troops.
      </p>
      <p>
        美国军队的存在对于叙利亚民主军维持叙东北部安全至关重要，事实上，叙民主军已多次表示，担心美国撤军将造成灾难性后果。通过减少对相对开明的叙民主军的适度支持，美国将让伊朗、俄罗斯和伊斯兰国(ISIS)得以在叙利亚扩大影响力，并扼杀该地区少有的民主独立运动。全面撤出叙利亚会更加糟糕，制造一个权力真空，让这些力量得以推行暴力反民主议程。驻伊拉克的2500名美军的情况亦是如此。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Some progressives have decried military intervention as a thinly veiled
        imperialist tool. In a 2020 interview, Matt Duss, then a foreign policy
        adviser to Sanders, described U.S. forces around the world as part of an
        “empire that we have created.” In many cases, such as the U.S.
        interventions in Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011, these arguments have
        proved to be well founded. But in some instances, military action has
        saved many lives. The British military intervention in Sierra Leone in
        2000, for example, was essential to sustaining UN peacekeeping forces
        there, ending the war, and fostering a peace that has lasted for more
        than 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        许多进步派人士曾痛斥军事干预是帝国主义的遮羞布。桑德斯的外交政策顾问马特·杜斯在2020年的一次采访中称，美国在全球的驻军是“我们建立的帝国”的一部分。在很多情况下，比如2003年和2011年美国对伊拉克和利比亚的军事干预，这些批评是有道理的。但在某些情况下，军事行动拯救了无数生命。例如，2000年英国军队对塞拉利昂的干预对于维持联合国维和部队、结束内战以及促成长达20多年的和平至关重要。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Outside of war, retrenchment can similarly undermine progressive goals.
        Consider the extensive role Washington played in preventing a coup in
        Brazil. From 2021 to 2022, the Biden administration worked with Luiz
        Inácio Lula da Silva, the democratically elected president of Brazil, to
        prevent supporters of the defeated incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, from
        illegally seizing power. The administration publicly supported Lula’s
        victory, encouraged U.S. allies to take the same position, and
        communicated to the Brazilian military that a coup would leave the
        country isolated and result in a downgrading of U.S. security
        cooperation. The result: violence was avoided, and a popularly elected,
        politically progressive president survived an antidemocratic challenge
        from his authoritarian rival. Washington has been complicit in a long
        history of abuses in South America. But on this occasion, it used its
        diplomatic influence to preserve democratic institutions. Had the United

        ended up with more violence and less democracy.

        在战争之外，紧缩也会同样损害进步目标。想想华盛顿在防止巴西政变中发挥的广泛作用吧。从2021年到2022年，拜登政府与巴西民选总统路易斯·因纳乔·卢拉·达席尔瓦合作，阻止了败选的现任总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗的支持者非法夺权。美国政府公开支持卢拉胜选，鼓励盟友采取相同立场，并向巴西军方传达了政变将使该国陷入孤立、导致美巴安全合作降级的信息。结果是：暴力得以避免，一位受欢迎的、政治上进步的民选总统抵挡住了来自极右翼对手的反民主挑战。美国在南美的历史上一直有滥用权力的行为。但这一次，它利用外交影响力维护了民主制度。如果当时美国不插手这场争端，巴西可能会出现更多暴力和更少的民主。

        Retrenchment from global markets, such as withdrawing from trade
        agreements or international economic institutions, can likewise create
        vacuums for bad actors to exploit. Consider the vacuum left behind by
        the failure of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal proposed by
        the Obama administration that would have strengthened economic ties
        between the United States and 11 other economies. When U.S. President
        Donald Trump killed the TPP in 2017, progressives such as Sanders,
        Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Representative Keith Ellison applauded.
        Progressives can debate what effect the TPP would have had on American
        jobs, and they can argue that the proposed agreement did not go far
        enough to uphold human rights and environmental or labor standards
        abroad. But the TPP’s failure did not ameliorate such abuses; it
        exacerbated them. The United States’ trading partners went on to look
        elsewhere for international economic leadership, and they found it in
        China. In 2020, 15 countries, including China, signed the Regional
        Comprehensive Economic Partnership, creating the largest economic bloc
        in history in a deal that includes none of the labor, human rights, or
        environmental protections envisioned in the TPP. The interests of
        American workers should always be considered, but progressive advocates
        of protectionism must also grapple with how their policies affect
        workers in developing countries.

        退出全球市场，比如退出贸易协定或国际经济机构，也会造成权力真空，让坏家伙们有机可乘。想想奥巴马政府提议的跨太平洋伙伴关系协定(TPP)吧。这一贸易协议原本将强化美国与另外11个经济体之间的经济联系，但由于未能通过，留下了真空。当唐纳德·特朗普(Donald
        Trump)总统在2017年扼杀了TPP时，桑德斯、参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦(Elizabeth
        Warren)和众议员基思·埃里森(Keith
        Ellison)等进步人士都表示欢迎。进步派可以辩论TPP对美国就业的影响，也可以争论说，拟议中的协议在维护国外的人权、环境或劳工标准方面做得不够。但TPP的失败并没有解决这些滥用问题，反而加剧了它们。美国的贸易伙伴转而向别处寻求国际经济领导力，他们在中国找到了。2020年，包括中国在内的15个国家签署了《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》(RCEP)，创建了史上最大的经济区，而该协议并未包含TPP设想的任何劳工、人权或环境保护措施。必须始终考虑美国工人的利益，但支持保护主义的进步人士也必须面对其政策如何影响发展中国家工人的问题。

        Progressives who push for restraint and retrenchment generally have
        little to say about how the United States should address its own
        security threats. Some advocates of restraint argue for “offshore
        balancing,” whereby Washington pulls back and relies instead on regional
        allies to keep challengers in check. Although this approach would reduce
        the direct role of the U.S. military in international conflicts, it
        still allows for the United States to exercise its influence in proxy
        wars that can be just as inimical to peace and security, if not more so.
        Today, autocratic countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia benefit from
        U.S. arms sales, joint military training exercises, and other security
        cooperation. Doling out military aid may keep U.S. troops out of harm’s
        way, but it does not necessarily reduce armed conflict. Often, it merely
        renders the United States complicit in violations of human rights and
        the laws of war, as in Israel’s war in Gaza and Saudi Arabia’s war in
        Yemen.
      </p>

        呼吁审慎和收缩的自由主义者通常很少讨论美国应该如何对付自身的安全威胁。一些审慎论者主张“离岸平衡”，即华盛顿撤退，依靠地区盟友来遏制挑战者。尽管这一做法会减少美军在国际冲突中的直接作用，但它仍然允许美国通过代理人战争来行使影响力，而这些战争可能对和平与安全的危害同样不小，甚至更大。如今，埃及和沙特阿拉伯等专制国家从美国的军火销售、联合军事演习和其他安全合作中获益。提供军事援助或许能让美国士兵远离危险，但这不一定能减少武装冲突。通常，这只会让美国在侵犯人权和战争法行为中成为共犯，比如以色列对加沙的战争和沙特对也门的战争。

        Progressives’ mistrust of U.S. foreign policy and intervention is
        understandable, given Washington’s long history of harmful military,
        political, and economic interference abroad. American power has often
        hindered progressive aims. But it has sometimes advanced them. A rigid
        commitment to restraint, no matter the circumstances and whatever the
        cost, is the stuff of ideological zealotry, not judicious policymaking.

        鉴于美国长期在海外实行有害的军事、政治和经济干预，进步人士对美国外交政策和干预的不信任是可以理解的。美国的强权政治常常损害了进步的目标。但有时候，它也推进了这些目标。不顾一切代价、在任何情况下都严格坚持克制，这是意识形态狂热的表现，而不是明智政策制定的结果。

        There are still areas in which Washington should pull back. The United
        States maintains territorial holdings around the world. To be consistent
        with the principles of anti-imperialism, Washington should start an
        ethical self-determination process for Guam, Puerto Rico, and other U.S.
        territories, which must include an option for statehood if those
        territories choose to remain in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        但华盛顿仍需在一些领域撤退。美国在世界各地拥有领土。为了与反帝国主义的原则保持一致，华盛顿应该启动关岛、波多黎各和其他美国领土的道德自决进程，这一过程必须包括如果这些领土选择留在美国，则成为州的选择。

        In other parts of the world, many peoples have been subjugated by
        powerful states, repressed through violence, and denied their political
        rights. Those who have organized in opposition to these conditions, such
        as the Sahrawis in Western Sahara and the Palestinians, should have the
        opportunity to seek self-determination, which can take the form of more
        autonomy, expanded domestic political rights and recognition, or
        recognition as an independent state. So long as self-determination does
        not lead to greater oppression and violence, the United States should
        support it.

        在世界其他地方，许多民族被强大的国家奴役，遭受暴力镇压，政治权利也被剥夺。那些起来反抗压迫的群体，比如西撒哈拉的萨拉威人和巴勒斯坦人，应该有机会争取自决权，形式可以多种多样，比如更大的自治权、更宽泛的国内政治权利和认可，或者被承认为独立国家。只要自决不会导致更多的压迫和暴力，美国就应当支持。

        At the UN, the United States should support reform efforts aimed at
        reducing the organization’s imperialist legacy. Reform is particularly
        urgent at the Security Council, where the permanent five members have
        too much sway and all other nations far too little. The United States
        should support a restructuring of the body with an eye to making it more
        representative of the distribution of global power and the countries
        most affected by UN intervention—for example, by advocating permanent UN
        Security Council representation for the powerful regional actors Brazil,
        Japan, and India. Although it is unlikely that either China or Russia
        would ever agree to give up its veto power entirely, a progressive case
        can also be made for changing the rules so that no country could use a
        veto in certain cases, such as to shield a state perpetrating mass
        atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
        在美国，应该支持旨在减少联合国帝国主义遗迹的改革努力。安理会尤其需要改革，五个常任理事国的权力过大，其他国家的发言权过小。美国应支持对这一机构进行重组，使其能更好地体现全球实力分布和受联合国干预影响最大的国家——比如，支持巴西、日本和印度这样的地区大国获得安理会常任席位。虽然中国和俄罗斯不太可能完全放弃否决权，但也有理由逐步改革否决权的使用规定，使其不能在保护种族屠杀等暴行实施国时使用否决权。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The United States should also consider how its treaties perpetuate forms
        of domination and subjugation. The Pentagon’s basing agreements, for
        example, should be reassessed to take into account the costs and
        benefits for the host country. Progressives have long argued for the
        closing of the notorious U.S. military base at Guantánamo Bay,
        Cuba—which Havana, with good reason, says is under U.S. “occupation.”
        Shutting it down would be a welcome step. There is nothing inherently
        wrong about U.S. military bases on foreign soil, as long as the host
        countries consent and as long as the presence of U.S. troops does not
        add to their burden. In the same spirit, the United States should
        overcome its concerns about potential prosecutions of its own military
        personnel and join the International Criminal Court.
      </p>
      <p>
        美国也应该审视其条约如何延续各种形式的统治和压迫。例如，五角大楼的军事基地协议应该重新评估，以考虑到对东道国的成本和益处。进步人士长期以来一直主张关闭臭名昭著的关塔那摩湾美军基地——哈瓦那有充分的理由称该地为“被占领土”。关闭它将是一个受欢迎的举措。只要东道国同意，且美军驻扎不会增加其负担，美国在外国领土上的军事基地本身并没有错。本着同样的精神，美国应克服其对本国军人可能受到起诉的担忧，加入国际刑事法院。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        U.S. trade and foreign investment should also be conducted in a manner
        that is consistent with labor protections, human rights, and
        environmental standards. The federal government already holds U.S.
        companies to certain baseline standards; the Foreign Corrupt Practices
        Act, for example, prohibits Americans from paying bribes to foreign
        governments. But Washington must do more to ensure that U.S.
        corporations operating abroad live up to the highest ideals. And if the
        host country’s environmental or labor practices surpass those of the
        United States, then it is incumbent on American firms to improve their
        own operations accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        美国的贸易和外国投资也应符合劳动保护、人权和环境标准。美国联邦政府已经对美国企业设定了一些基本标准，比如《反海外腐败行为法》(Foreign
        Corrupt Practices
        Act)就禁止美国人向外国政府行贿。但华盛顿必须做更多工作，以确保美国企业在海外运营时能遵守最高标准。如果东道国的环境或劳工标准超过美国，那么美国企业就有责任提高自身的做法。

        Progressives are rightly skeptical about the ability of military force
        to achieve political goals. But there are scenarios in which the use of
        force aligns with progressive principles: military support for
        anti-imperialist efforts, limited humanitarian interventions, and
        defensive wars of necessity. Washington should rarely resort to military
        solutions to international problems, but it must retain the capacity—and
        the will—to wield force or support its use by others in ways that align
        with progressive principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        进步人士有理由对军事手段能否实现政治目标表示怀疑。但在某些情况下，军事力量的使用可能符合进步主义原则：支持反帝国主义的努力、有限的人道主义干预以及必要时的自卫战争。华盛顿不应当频繁诉诸军事手段来解决国际问题，但它必须保持实力——以及意志——以符合进步主义原则的方式来使用武力，或支持他人使用武力。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Military, economic, and humanitarian support to anti-imperialist
        combatants is consistent with progressive principles, as long as the
        recipients comply with international humanitarian law and norms
        regarding the use of force. Countries with long traditions of
        progressivism have historically supported anti-imperialist actions
        around the world; Sweden, for example, supplied humanitarian aid to
        national liberation movements in Mozambique and Guinea Bissau in the
        1960s and 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
        对反帝国主义斗士的军事、经济和人道主义支持，只要受援者遵守国际人道法和关于使用武力的规范，就符合进步原则。那些有着悠久进步历史的国家过去常常支持全世界的反帝国主义行动；例如，瑞典在二十世纪六七十年代向莫桑比克和几内亚比绍的民族解放运动提供了人道主义援助。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Even direct military involvement can be consistent with progressive
        values. Many humanitarian interventions have intensified violence and
        prolonged wars—as in Libya, where the NATO coalition overstepped its
        narrow mandate of protecting civilians and ended up facilitating regime
        change. But there are notable exceptions, such as when the United States
        and its coalition partners expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the Gulf
        War. There have also been countless humanitarian crises, such as in
        Rwanda in 1994, in Srebrenica in 1995, and in Sri Lanka in 2009, in
        which the United States failed to intervene—and in which even a modest
        military intervention would likely have reduced human suffering without
        exacerbating violence. The political scientist Alan Kuperman has
        estimated that a “minimum intervention” to stop the Rwandan genocide
        could have saved about 75,000 lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        即便直接军事介入也可以符合进步价值观。许多所谓的人道主义干预反而加剧了暴力、延长了战争——比如在利比亚，北约联盟超越了保护平民的有限授权，最终导致了政权更迭。但也有一些明显的例外情况，比如美国及其盟友在海湾战争中将伊拉克部队赶出科威特。还有无数人道主义危机，比如1994年的卢旺达、1995年的斯雷布雷尼察和2009年的斯里兰卡，美国未能采取行动；而就算适度的军事介入也很可能减少人间苦难，而不会加剧暴力。政治学家艾伦·库珀曼(Alan
        Kuperman)估计，如果当年对阻止卢旺达大屠杀的“最低限度介入”，本可以拯救大约75,000条生命。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Finally, wars for defensive purposes, whether in defense of the United
        States or U.S. allies, are generally consistent with progressive values,
        so long as they are fought in ways that align with international
        humanitarian law and the laws of war. No mainstream progressive has
        called for surrendering the country’s right to national self-defense.
        But many of them advocate policies that could gut the United States’
        defensive capabilities, capabilities that deter aggression by making war
        less desirable for would-be aggressors. For this reason, although
        progressives are right to call for cuts to the U.S. defense
        budget—which, at nearly $900 billion a year, remains the world’s
        largest—a progressive national security policy must prioritize the
        maintenance of an adequate defense base.
      </p>
      <p>
        最后，进步主义者普遍支持出于自卫目的发动的战争，无论是为保卫美国本土还是美国盟友，只要这些战争符合国际人道主义法和战争法。没有一个主流进步主义者主张放弃国家的自卫权。但许多进步主义者支持的政策可能会削弱美国的防御能力——这种能力通过让潜在侵略者认为发动战争不值得来威慑侵略。因此，尽管呼吁削减美国国防预算（每年接近9000亿美元，仍是全球最高）是正确的，但进步主义国家安全政策必须优先维护足够的国防基础。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Allies also form part of the broader U.S. defense apparatus. Too often,
        however, Washington acts as if it is not morally complicit in violence
        carried out by partners that receive its equipment and training, such as
        Israel, Niger, and Saudi Arabia. The United States does condition
        military aid and arms sales on assurances from recipients that the
        support will not be used to commit human rights abuses or contravene
        international law. But it must strengthen and consistently enforce those
        standards and better monitor allies’ use of American weapons. And if
        there are violations, it should work with the communities affected by
        the violence to find just solutions for harm done—by offering
        reparations, rebuilding housing, and providing food and medicine, for
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        盟友也是美国防务体系的一部分。然而，华盛顿常常表现得好像对那些接受其装备和训练、如以色列、尼日尔和沙特阿拉伯等国实施的暴力行为并无道德责任。美国确实会要求军援和军售接收国保证不会用这些援助来侵犯人权或违反国际法。但美国必须强化并始终如一地执行这些标准，并更好地监控盟友对美国武器的使用。如有违规行为，美国应该与暴力行为影响到的社区合作，为所造成的伤害找到公正的解决方案——比如提供赔偿、重建住房以及提供食品和药品。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Solidarity with the oppressed lies at the heart of progressive politics,
        but any attempt to promote egalitarianism abroad must be done in
        collaboration with the people on the receiving end. The United States
        should think twice before imposing harsh economic penalties on a country
        to achieve greater political and economic justice there. The strict
        limits that the U.S. government imposed on aid to Taliban-run
        Afghanistan, for instance, have exacerbated the risk of famine and
        deprived civilians of funds they need to buy fuel to heat their homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        对弱势群体的同情是进步政治的核心，但在国外推动平等主义必须与当地人民合作。美国在对一个国家实施严厉经济惩罚以期实现更多政治和经济正义之前，应该三思。例如，在塔利班统治下，美国政府对阿富汗援助设定的严格限制加剧了饥荒风险，并剥夺了民众购买取暖燃料所需的资金。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The United States’ broader involvement in Afghanistan illustrates that
        no single progressive solution can solve all foreign policy problems.
        And any solution will almost always require tradeoffs. The thorniest
        tradeoffs were those that arose with the withdrawal of U.S. troops from
        Afghanistan in 2021. The United States’ sudden departure was deeply
        unfair to its Afghan partners and damaging to its credibility with
        allies across the globe. The Taliban takeover has been devastating for
        many Afghans, especially women and girls. At the same time, it’s not
        clear whether the U.S. presence in Afghanistan could ever have helped
        the country achieve political and economic stability, and continuing to
        fight the Taliban would likely have claimed many more civilian lives.
        Good progressive arguments can be made in either direction. At the time,
        however, the near-universal consensus among progressives was that
        withdrawal was an easy call. A more informed progressive foreign policy
        would grapple with the inevitable tradeoffs and try to minimize their
        ill effects.
      </p>

        美国在阿富汗的长期介入表明，没有任何单一的进步解决方案可以解决所有外交政策问题；几乎总是需要权衡取舍。最棘手的权衡出现在2021年从阿富汗撤军时。美国的突然撤离对它的阿富汗伙伴极不公平，也损害了它在全球盟友中的可信度。塔利班接管对许多阿富汗人来说是一场灾难，尤其是对妇女和女孩而言。与此同时，美国在阿富汗的存在能否帮助这个国家实现政治和经济稳定还存在疑问，而继续与塔利班战斗很可能将夺去更多平民的生命。可以为任一方向提出有力的进步论据。但当时，进步人士普遍一致认为撤军是不言而喻的选择。一种更加明智的进步外交政策将不得不面对不可避免的权衡，并努力将其负面影响降到最低。

        Although U.S. President Joe Biden has distinguished himself as one of
        the most progressive presidents in recent memory on domestic policy, his
        foreign policy record is more ambiguous. His administration was quick to
        condemn threats to democracy in Brazil and has supplied an enormous
        amount of military assistance to Ukraine. But in its response to
        Israel’s war in Gaza, it has fallen short. Although Biden has pressured
        Israel to exercise more restraint in its campaign, as of this writing in
        May, he has declined to publicly condemn Israel’s obstruction of
        humanitarian aid. The weapons pause was a welcome step, but the United
        States must do much more to enforce laws prohibiting military support to
        any country that commits gross violations of international law.
      </p>
      <p>
        尽管美国总统乔·拜登在内政方面堪称近年来最进步的总统之一，但他的外交政策记录却没那么明确。拜登政府迅速谴责了对巴西民主的威胁，并向乌克兰提供了大量军事援助。但在应对以色列对加沙的战争时，它却没有达到标准。虽然拜登已施压以色列在军事行动中更加克制，但截至本文5月上旬撰写之时，他拒绝公开谴责以色列阻挠人道主义援助的行为。暂停军售是受欢迎的一步，但美国必须采取更多措施来执行禁止向任何违反国际法犯下严重罪行的国家提供军事支持的法律。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Even as the Biden administration has called for sustained support for
        Ukraine, it has overlooked crises elsewhere. In Sudan, for example,
        civil war has claimed 15,000 lives in the last year, and more than eight
        million civilians have been displaced. Yet Washington has failed to
        supply adequate emergency aid or even to exert pressure on the United
        Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, to stop fueling the conflict through
        illicit arms sales. The United States, one of the largest emitters of
        greenhouse gas, has also neglected the victims of climate change,
        allocating only meager resources for climate adaptation in low- and
        middle-income countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        就在拜登政府呼吁对乌克兰提供持续支持的同时，它却忽视了其他地区的危机。例如，在苏丹，去年内战夺去了1.5万人的生命，800多万平民流离失所。然而，华盛顿未能提供足够的紧急援助，甚至未能向美国的亲密盟友阿联酋施加压力，要求其停止通过非法军售加剧冲突。美国作为最大的温室气体排放国之一，也忽视了气候变化的受害者，仅为中低收入国家的气候适应分配了微薄的资源。

        Progressive critics of U.S. foreign policy are right: for too long,
        Washington has wielded power recklessly, dismissed concerns about
        justice and equality, and done nothing to check imperialism. But
        retrenchment is not the answer. Turning inward may in fact exacerbate
        some of the problems progressives care about most. Rather than retreat
        from the global stage, the United States should use its power to respond
        ethically, humanely, and justly to a world of tradeoffs.
