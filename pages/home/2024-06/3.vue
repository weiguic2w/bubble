        On October 25, 1962, at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, Adlai
        Stevenson, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, confronted his Soviet
        counterpart, Valerian Zorin, in the chamber of the Security Council.
        Live on television, Stevenson grilled Zorin about whether the Soviet
        Union had deployed nuclear-capable missiles to Cuba. “Yes or no?”
        Stevenson demanded. As Zorin waffled, Stevenson went in for the kill: “I
        am prepared to wait for an answer until hell freezes over if that’s your
        decision. And I’m also prepared to present the evidence in this room.”
        Stevenson then revealed poster-sized photographs taken by a
        high-altitude U-2 spy plane, images that showed Soviet missile bases in
        Cuba and directly contradicted Moscow’s denials. Stevenson’s revelations
        marked a turning point in the crisis, providing undeniable evidentiary
        support to the Kennedy administration’s allegations, shifting global
        opinion, and pressuring the Soviets to de-escalate by isolating them
        diplomatically. It was the first time the U.S. government had
        declassified top-secret intelligence to publicly refute another
        country’s claims.

        1962年10月25日，正值古巴导弹危机最紧张的时刻，美国驻联合国大使阿德莱·史蒂文森在安理会会场上，面对苏联代表瓦列里安·佐林进行了一场针锋相对的质询。电视直播镜头下，史蒂文森追问佐林：苏联是否已在古巴部署了核导弹。“是或不是？”史蒂文森穷追不舍。佐林闪烁其词之际，史蒂文森乘胜追击：“如果苏联选择沉默，我可以等，哪怕等到地狱结冰。我也准备在这里出示证据。”接着，他亮出了大幅照片，那些照片由高空U-2侦察机拍摄，清晰地显示出苏联在古巴的导弹基地，与莫斯科的否认直接对峙。史蒂文森的展示成为危机的转折点，为肯尼迪政府的说法提供了无可辩驳的证据，改变了国际舆论，并通过外交孤立迫使苏联缓和紧张局势。这是美国政府首次解密绝密情报，公开反驳另一个国家的说法。

        Nearly 60 years later, Moscow looked poised to flex its muscle again,
        this time by amassing nearly 175,000 troops on the Russian border with
        Ukraine. Echoing the Kennedy administration’s approach, the Biden
        administration responded by publicly disclosing intelligence, both to
        warn allies (and Ukraine) of the coming invasion and to preemptively
        rebut Russian President Vladimir Putin’s planned pretexts for it. In
        early December 2021, administration officials started sharing the
        intelligence community’s growing concern with the media, holding a
        briefing that was accompanied by satellite imagery showing Russian
        forces staging on Ukraine’s borders. In mid-January 2022, John Kirby,
        then the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters that Russia was
        preparing a “false-flag operation” in eastern Ukraine, hoping to
        fabricate a massacre to justify an invasion. Later that month, U.S.
        officials revealed that the Russian military had moved blood supplies to
        the border of Ukraine, suggesting that war was imminent. And on February
        18, President Joe Biden said he was “convinced” that Russia’s invasion
        would begin in the “coming days”—as it did.
      </p>
      <p>
        将近60年后，莫斯科似乎准备再次炫耀武力，这一次是集结近17.5万兵力于乌克兰边境。跟肯尼迪政府当年的做法一样，拜登政府也通过公开情报作出回应：既警告盟友（和乌克兰）俄罗斯即将入侵，又预先反驳俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京为入侵找的借口。2021年12月初，政府官员开始向媒体透露情报界日益加剧的担忧，并举行简报会，还附上了显示俄罗斯军队在乌克兰边境集结的卫星图像。2022年1月中旬，时任五角大楼发言人约翰·柯比告诉记者，俄罗斯正在东乌克兰策划“假旗行动”，希望能制造一起屠杀事件作为入侵的借口。当月晚些时候，美国官员透露，俄罗斯已将血库运到乌克兰边境，表明战争迫在眉睫。2月18日，美国总统拜登说，他“确信”俄罗斯将在“未来几天”发动入侵——果不其然。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The Biden administration’s disclosures didn’t persuade Putin to shelve
        his war plans, but they did fortify Western resolve after the invasion.
        Advance warning of Russia’s plans enabled many U.S. allies, particularly
        NATO members, to quickly offer military aid packages to Ukraine and
        harmonize their economic sanctions against Russia. The revelations about
        the contrived provocations that Putin was scheming helped turn public
        opinion in the West against Russia by denying him a pretext for the
        invasion. Inside the Biden administration, the disclosure strategy was
        seen as a resounding success.
      </p>
      <p>
        拜登政府的揭露未能说服普京放弃战争计划，但在入侵发生后，它们确实强化了西方的决心。对俄罗斯意图的预警使美国的许多盟友——尤其是北约成员国——能够迅速向乌克兰提供军事援助，并协调对俄经济制裁。对于普京策划的虚假挑衅的揭露有助于在西方形成反俄舆论，从而剥夺了他入侵的借口。在拜登政府内部，这一信息披露策略被视为巨大的成功。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        In the six decades after the Kennedy administration’s novel move at the
        UN, successive White Houses adopted the tactic from time to time. But
        their disclosures were “one and done” affairs. What is new now is that
        the Biden team has disclosed information multiple times on a single
        issue over an extended period. What’s more, because the Ukraine-related
        revelations seemed to work so well, the administration is now applying
        the tool to other issues, most notably China. It has even come up with
        terms for the practice, with officials speaking of “strategic
        downgrades” and “strategic declassification.” What used to be a
        break-glass option is now routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        从肯尼迪政府在联合国采取这一创新举措后的六十年里，历任白宫不时也会使用这一手段。但它们通常只公开一次情报，然后就到此为止。而现在，拜登团队在延长的时间段内就单一问题多次披露信息，这尚属首次。而且，由于涉及乌克兰的情报似乎很有效，该政府现在正将这一工具应用于其他问题，尤其是与中国有关的问题。官员们甚至为这种做法起了名字，称之为“战略降级”和“战略解密”。以前的应急选项如今成了家常便饭。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        But as strategic downgrades become more common, policymakers and
        intelligence practitioners need to develop guardrails to protect against
        their pitfalls. Without proper precautions, a disclosure might
        compromise the source of the declassified information or, if the
        revelation turns out to be wrong, harm the intelligence community’s
        reputation and undermine the goal the disclosure was meant to achieve.
        The biggest risk, however, is that using intelligence as a policy tool
        increases the chances that it will also be used as a political weapon.
        Were that to happen, the intelligence community could lose its most
        precious asset: its reputation for objectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        但随着战略降级变得越来越普遍，决策者和情报官员需要制定保护措施，防范其潜在风险。如果没有适当的预防措施，公开降级的情报可能会暴露信息来源，或者如果情报被证明有误，将损害情报机构的声誉，并破坏信息公开原本想要实现的目标。然而，最大的风险是，将情报作为政策工具会增加它被用作政治武器的可能性。一旦这种情况发生，情报界可能会失去其最宝贵的资产：客观性的声誉。

      <h3>A NOT-SO-SECRET HISTORY</h3>
      <h3>不那么“秘密”的历史</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Although high-level officials have long leaked classified intelligence
        to the media, strategic disclosures are something different. They aim to
        use intelligence to further a specific administration goal rather than
        advance a particular bureaucratic player’s individual interest.
        Accordingly, disclosures are known in advance by a group of senior
        officials, including those with declassification authority, and are
        usually coordinated with relevant stakeholders, including the agency
        that collected the intelligence. They can enter the public domain
        directly—for example, through an on-the-record press conference, a
        televised speech or interview, or an intelligence product posted on a
        government website. Or they can take a more circuitous route, such as
        through a background briefing to journalists, who can use the
        information but agree not to name the official providing it. Strategic
        downgrades may or may not go through a formal declassification process,
        but unlike unauthorized leaks, they are legal, because officials with
        declassification authority have been involved in the decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        虽然高级官员向媒体泄露机密情报由来已久，但战略情报披露则另当别论。它们旨在利用情报来推进某个具体行政目标，而不是促进某个特定官僚机构的个人利益。因此，披露行动会事先告知包括解密权限官员在内的一群高层官员，并通常会与相关利益方（包括搜集情报的机构）协调一致。它们可以直接进入公共领域——例如通过正式的新闻发布会、电视演讲或采访，或政府网站上发布的智库产品。或者通过更曲折的方式，如向记者进行不具名吹风会，记者可以使用这些信息，但不能透露提供信息的官员姓名。战略降级可能经过也可能不经过正式的解密流程，但与未经授权的泄密不同，它们是合法的，因为具有解密权限的官员参与了决策过程。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Since the Cuban missile crisis, administrations have resorted to
        strategic declassification for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, the goal
        is to preemptively justify a policy. That was the purpose of the
        memorable, but ultimately incorrect, speech that Secretary of State
        Colin Powell gave to the UN Security Council in February 2003. Flanked
        by George Tenet, the director of the CIA, Powell played a tape of an
        intercepted conversation between Iraqi military officers conspiring to
        mislead weapons inspectors, showed satellite imagery of alleged weapons
        sites, and displayed drawings of supposed biological weapons labs.
        President Barack Obama made a similar move in 2013, after the Syrian
        regime of Bashar al-Assad fired rockets filled with sarin gas at a
        Damascus suburb and killed more than a thousand civilians. As the White
        House contemplated airstrikes, it released a summary of the intelligence
        community’s “high-confidence assessment” that the Syrian government had
        carried out the attack. In the end, the administration decided not to
        respond militarily, but had it done so, the declassified intelligence
        would have been foundational to the case for action by contradicting
        Syria’s repeated denials of responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        自古巴导弹危机以来，历届政府出于多种原因诉诸战略解密。有时，这样做的目的是为政策辩解，预作准备。2003年2月，国务卿科林·鲍威尔（Colin
        Powell）在联合国安理会发表的那场令人难忘、但最终被证明有误的演讲就是为此目的服务的。中央情报局局长乔治·特尼特（George
        Tenet）站在鲍威尔身边，鲍威尔播放了截获的伊拉克军官谈话录音，他们在密谋误导武器核查人员，展示了据称是武器设施的卫星图像，并展示了据称的生化武器实验室的图纸。2013年，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德（Bashar
        al-Assad）政权向大马士革郊区发射装满沙林毒气的火箭弹，杀害1000多名平民后，巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack
        Obama）总统也采取了类似的行动。白宫考虑对叙动武之际，公布了情报界关于叙政府发动袭击的“高度确信评估”的摘要。最后，政府决定不采取军事回应。但如果它这么做了，解密的情报将成为采取行动的理由的基础，因为这些情报反驳了叙利亚政府一再否认责任的说法。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        At other times, disclosures are made to retroactively justify a policy.
        Such was the case in 1983, when Soviet pilots shot down a South Korean
        commercial airliner that had strayed into Soviet airspace. U.S.
        President Ronald Reagan declassified signals intelligence to show Soviet
        culpability and justify his confrontational posture toward Moscow. At
        the Security Council, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick,
        played a tape of Soviet pilots’ intercepted radio conversations with
        their commander as they homed in on the plane. Three years later, the
        administration repeated the strategy with Libya. After ordering
        airstrikes against the regime of Muammar al-Qaddafi for having
        orchestrated a terrorist attack that killed U.S. troops at a discotheque
        in West Berlin, Reagan, in a speech from the Oval Office, summarized
        diplomatic cables intercepted by the National Security Agency that
        proved Libyan responsibility for the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        有时，情报解密是为了事后为某一政策辩解。1983年，苏联飞行员击落了一架误入苏联领空的韩国客机。美国时任总统罗纳德·里根解密了信号情报，以证明苏联应负责任，并为他对莫斯科采取的对抗立场正名。在联合国安理会，美国常驻联合国代表珍妮·柯克帕特里克播放了一段苏联飞行员与指挥官无线电通话的录音，他们在追踪那架飞机。三年后，政府对利比亚故伎重演。在下令对卡扎菲政权实施空袭（因为它策划了导致美国士兵在西柏林一家迪斯科舞厅死亡的恐怖袭击）之后，里根在椭圆形办公室发表讲话，概述了国家安全局截获的、证实利比亚应对袭击负责的外交电报。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Sometimes, policymakers disclose intelligence to undermine or pressure
        their adversaries. In 1984, the Reagan administration released
        declassified sketches based on classified satellite photography showing
        that the Soviets were constructing a radar station in Siberia, an
        outpost the administration claimed violated the Anti-Ballistic Missile
        Treaty. The goal was to strengthen the United States’ position in arms
        control talks and demonstrate that the U.S. government was closely
        monitoring Soviet military developments. (Years later, the Soviets
        dismantled the facility.) More recently, in 2009, Obama held a press
        conference with his British and French counterparts and announced that
        the Iranians had built a covert uranium enrichment site. As an
        administration official explained to reporters in an accompanying
        background briefing, the conclusion was based on “very sensitive
        intelligence information.” The disclosure worked: it generated
        international pressure on the Iranians, compelling them to bring the
        site under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
      </p>
      <p>
        决策者有时会披露情报来削弱或向对手施压。1984年，里根政府公开展示了根据机密卫星照片绘制的草图，显示苏联正在西伯利亚建造一座雷达站，而白宫声称这座设施违反了反弹道导弹条约。此举是为了在军控谈判中加强美国的立场，以及表明美国政府密切关注着苏联的军事发展。(几年后，苏联拆除了这座设施。)最近的例子是，2009年，奥巴马与英法两国首脑一道举行新闻发布会，宣布伊朗正在秘密建造一个铀浓缩设施。一位政府官员在随行的吹风会上对记者解释说，这一结论是基于“非常敏感的情报信息”。这次情报披露取得了效果：它引发了国际社会对伊朗的压力，迫使其将该设施置于国际原子能机构的保障监督之下。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        At other times, the U.S. government has used official disclosures to
        deal with unauthorized ones. In 2007, the George W. Bush administration
        worried that an intelligence estimate about Iran’s nuclear program would
        leak. The estimate concluded that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons
        program four years earlier, and the White House feared that the
        revelation of that specific conclusion would undermine its argument that
        Iran still posed a threat. So it released an unclassified version of the
        paper’s key judgments to make clear that the country was continuing to
        work on both uranium enrichment and dual-use weapons technologies. The
        Obama administration resorted to the same strategy in 2013. When the
        National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked highly
        classified documents about the U.S. government’s global surveillance
        programs, the administration responded with its own disclosures. It
        released an overview of the programs to counter media stories that
        characterized them as being more pervasive and less subject to legal
        scrutiny than they actually were. The NSA’s director, Keith Alexander,
        even made an unprecedented appearance on 60 Minutes to share several
        previously classified pieces of information (such as the fact that the
        NSA was targeting the communications of fewer than 60 “U.S. persons”
        worldwide).
      </p>
      <p>
        美国政府有时会通过官方披露来应对未经授权的泄密。2007年，小布什政府担心关于伊朗核计划的一份情报评估报告会被泄露出去。该报告的结论是，伊朗在四年前就已中止了核武器项目，白宫害怕这一具体结论的曝光将削弱其有关伊朗仍构成威胁的说法。因此，政府发布了这份报告关键判断部分的非密版，以表明伊朗仍在推进铀浓缩和军民两用武器技术的研发。2013年，奥巴马政府也采取了类似策略。当国家安全局承包商爱德华·斯诺登泄露了有关美国政府全球监控项目的高度机密文件后，政府作出回应，自行公开了相关信息。它发布了一份项目概述，以纠正媒体那些夸大其词的报道（例如，称这些项目比实际情况更为普遍，且受到的法律审查更少）。国家安全局局长基思·亚历山大甚至破天荒地出现在《60分钟》节目上，分享了几项之前被列为机密的信息（比如，国家安全局针对全球范围内不到60名“美国公民”的通信进行监听）。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Other disclosures are motivated by an administration’s desire to protect
        its reputation. In 2004, a member of the 9/11 Commission questioned
        National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice about a seemingly damning
        item that appeared in the President’s Daily Brief on August 6, 2001:
        “Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US.” Just two days later, the Bush
        administration released the top-secret memo with minimal redactions to
        show that the document contained no specific warning of, or any
        actionable information about, a near-term attack. Likewise, in 2016,
        when the Obama administration wanted to counter criticism about civilian
        casualties caused by U.S. drone strikes, it released the intelligence
        community’s own count, which was much lower than the number calculated
        by critics.
      </p>
      <p>
        有的信息披露是为了保护政府的声誉。2004年，9·11事件委员会的一名成员询问国家安全顾问康多莉扎·赖斯，为何总统每日简报在2001年8月6日会有这样一条看似不祥的情报：“本·拉登决心打击美国”。两天后，布什政府几乎未作删减就公布了这份绝密文件，以证明其中并未包含对近期袭击的具体警告，也没有可采取行动的情报。同样，在2016年，为了回应关于美国无人机袭击造成平民伤亡的批评，奥巴马政府发布了情报机构计算出的、远低于批评者统计数字的平民伤亡人数。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Finally, U.S. policymakers have at times released intelligence to
        pressure Congress. In December 2023, Section 702 of the Foreign
        Intelligence Surveillance Act was set to expire. The provision allows
        the U.S. government to access the communications of foreigners outside
        the United States who have been targeted for intelligence purposes and
        whose communications pass through the United States. To encourage
        Congress to reauthorize Section 702, the administration declassified
        information showing its value. Officials revealed that the provision had
        proved crucial to tracking fentanyl smuggling across the Mexican border
        and identifying the hacker behind the 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial
        Pipeline. The administration even disclosed that in 2022, 59 percent of
        the pieces in Biden’s President’s Daily Briefs contained information
        collected under the authorities of Section 702. But the disclosures
        don’t appear to have worked: although the program was temporarily
        reauthorized, as of this writing, in March, permanent reauthorization
        remains stalled in Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
        美国决策者有时也会出于游说国会的目的而披露情报。2023年12月，《外国情报监听法》第702条即将到期。该条款允许美国政府获取那些因情报目的被盯上、其通讯途径美国的境外人士的通讯内容。为了促使国会重新授权第702条，政府解密了证明其价值的信息。官员透露，这一条款对于追踪经由墨西哥边境走私的芬太尼和确定2021年殖民地管道公司勒索软件攻击背后的黑客至关重要。政府甚至披露，2022年，拜登总统每日简报中59%的内容含有根据第702条收集的情报。但这些信息披露似乎并未奏效：虽然该计划暂时获得延长，但截至本文撰写之时，永久延长仍卡在国会。

        The Biden administration’s disclosures about Russia’s war in Ukraine did
        not stop when the shooting started. In fact, they only gained pace. A
        month after the invasion, Biden revealed that Russia was considering
        using chemical and biological weapons in the conflict. By the end of
        2023, with domestic enthusiasm for continued support for Ukraine
        flagging and Congress at an impasse over aid, it yet again resorted to
        strategic declassification. To demonstrate Ukraine’s success in the war
        and the effectiveness of U.S. military aid, it released the U.S.
        intelligence community’s estimate that Russia had suffered an
        astonishing 315,000 casualties since the invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        拜登政府对俄罗斯在乌克兰的战争的公开揭露并没有随着战争的爆发而停止。事实上，这些揭露有增无减。入侵一个月后，拜登透露，俄罗斯可能正在考虑在这场冲突中使用化学和生物武器。到了2023年底，随着美国民众对继续支持乌克兰的热情减弱，国会在援助问题上僵持不下，美国再次诉诸战略解密。为了证明乌克兰在战争中的成功以及美国军事援助的效果，它公布了美国情报部门的评估结果，即自入侵以来，俄罗斯的损失人数高达31.5万。

        The Biden administration is now using strategic downgrades against
        China, too. In August 2022, on the eve of Speaker of the House Nancy
        Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, Kirby, by then a National Security Council
        spokesperson, shared details from a declassified assessment of actions
        Beijing could take to register its displeasure, such as launching
        missiles into the Taiwan Strait. The goal: to preemptively remove the
        sting from any Chinese provocations. In February 2023, after a Chinese
        high-altitude balloon floated across U.S. airspace, the administration
        declassified details about it, in part to justify to the public its
        intense focus on competition with China and in part to signal to Beijing
        the U.S. intelligence community’s impressive technical capabilities. The
        Pentagon released a close-up photo of the balloon taken by a U-2 pilot,
        and officials explained to reporters that the U.S. government could
        track the object and had determined that it was loitering above
        sensitive military sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        拜登政府现在也在对中国进行战略性下调。2022年8月，在众议院议长南希·佩洛西(Nancy
        Pelosi)访问台湾前夕，时任美国国家安全委员会(National Security
        Council)发言人的柯比分享了一份解密评估报告的细节，该报告对北京可能采取的行动表示不满，比如向台湾海峡发射导弹。其目标是:先发制人地消除中国任何挑衅的刺痛。2023年2月，在一个中国高空气球飞越美国领空后，美国政府解密了有关它的细节，部分原因是为了向公众证明，美国高度关注与中国的竞争是合理的，部分原因是为了向北京表明，美国情报界拥有令人印象深刻的技术能力。五角大楼发布了一张U-2飞行员拍摄的气球特写照片，官员们向记者解释说，美国政府可以追踪到这个物体，并确定它在敏感的军事地点上空徘徊。

        Later that month, the administration sought to warn Beijing that it was
        monitoring possible Chinese support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. CIA
        Director William Burns, undoubtedly with the approval of other senior
        officials, revealed in a televised interview that Beijing was
        considering offering Moscow lethal aid, adding, “We don’t see evidence
        of actual shipments of lethal equipment.” Burns clearly wanted to brush
        back the Chinese before they crossed a line they couldn’t uncross.

        当月晚些时候，拜登政府试图警告北京，美国正密切关注中国可能对俄罗斯在乌克兰战争中的支持。中情局局长威廉·伯恩斯（William
        Burns）——无疑得到了其他资深官员的批准——在接受电视采访时透露，中方正在考虑向莫斯科提供致命援助，并补充说，“我们没有看到实际运送致命装备的证据。”伯恩斯显然想在中方越线之前敲山震虎。

        In the first few months of the war in Gaza, the Biden administration
        used intelligence disclosures to give Israel breathing space from
        mounting pressure about the destructiveness of its military campaign.
        Shortly after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack, Adrienne Watson, a
        spokesperson for the National Security Council, countered accusations
        that an Israeli bomb had struck a hospital in Gaza City, announcing that
        “overhead imagery, intercepts, and open-source information” suggested
        that the real culprit was an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in
        Gaza. In November, the White House again came to Israel’s defense, with
        Kirby sharing a declassified intelligence assessment saying that Hamas
        was using hospitals as command-and-control nodes, weapons depots, and
        hideaways for Israeli hostages.

        在加沙战争最初的几个月里，拜登政府利用情报披露为以色列提供了喘息的空间，以应对对其军事行动破坏性越来越大的批评。在2023年10月7日哈马斯发动袭击后不久，白宫国家安全委员会发言人阿德里安娜·沃森反驳了有关以色列炸弹击中加沙市一家医院的说法，宣布“航拍图像、截获的信息和开源信息”表明，真正的罪魁祸首是加沙一个恐怖组织发射的一枚误射火箭。11月，白宫再次出面为以色列辩护，Kirby分享了一份解密的情报评估报告，称哈马斯将医院用作指挥和控制中心、武器库以及藏匿以色列人质的地点。

        Strategic disclosures are set to become a durable feature of the U.S.
        foreign policy landscape. The Biden administration’s strategic
        downgrades have created an expectation on the part of the public, the
        media, and allies that there will be more to come, and it is unlikely
        that Biden or any of his successors will abandon the tool. The genie is
        out of the bottle.
      </p>
      <p>
        战略降级很可能会成为美国外交政策的持久特征。拜登政府的一系列降级操作已经让公众、媒体和盟友都以为还有更多此类行动，而拜登或任何继任者都不太可能放弃这一手段。这个魔咒已经无法收回了。

    <div>
      <p>
        But is any of this a good idea? Most policymakers seem to think so. For
        one thing, they have argued, disclosures have delivered results. Writing
        in these pages earlier this year, Burns argued that the Ukraine
        disclosures put Putin “in the uncomfortable and unaccustomed position of
        being on the back foot” and “bolstered both Ukraine and the coalition
        supporting it.” And it is reasonable to conclude that administration
        officials give at least partial credit to Burns’s disclosure about
        Beijing’s consideration of lethal aid to Russia for convincing Chinese
        leader Xi Jinping to not cross the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        但这真的是个好主意吗?大多数政策制定者似乎都这么认为。他们认为，首先，信息披露带来了结果。伯恩斯今年早些时候在《纽约时报》撰文指出，乌克兰事件的披露让普京“处于一种不舒服、不习惯的被动地位”，并“支持了乌克兰和支持乌克兰的联盟”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The second argument made by proponents of disclosures is that any
        transparency on the part of the secret state is good. Although Director
        of National Intelligence Avril Haines’s 2023 National Intelligence
        Strategy says nothing about strategic downgrades—a missed opportunity—it
        does endorse increased openness. Haines has elaborated on the idea,
        saying, “With the increasing importance of national security in our
        everyday lives, the more we can help to inform the public debate around
        such issues, the better.” This push for transparency is driven in part
        by the deluge of publicly available open-source intelligence, which
        invites doubts about the value of the intelligence community in a world
        where Bellingcat and other investigative groups seem to know as much as
        governments. (By the same token, however, open-source intelligence frees
        agencies to say more about what they know while jeopardizing less.) The
        push is also motivated by the public’s growing desire for government
        accountability in the wake of the intelligence failures behind the U.S.
        invasion of Iraq, revelations about the NSA’s industrial-scale
        information-collection capabilities, and Trump’s claims that the
        intelligence community and the rest of the “deep state” undermined his
        presidency. Disclosures, the argument runs, can rebuild public trust in
        the U.S. intelligence community, in part by demonstrating its value.
      </p>
      <p>
        秘密国家的提倡者提出的第二个理由是，任何透明度都是好的。虽然国家情报总监阿夫里尔·海恩斯(Avril
        Haines)的2023年国家情报战略没有提及战略降级——这是一个错失的机会——但它确实支持提高开放度。海恩斯进一步阐述了这一想法，称“随着国家安全在我们日常生活中的重要性日益增强，我们在这些问题上帮助公众形成辩论的能力越强，就越好”。这种对透明度的推动部分是由公开来源情报的洪流驱动的，这引发了人们对情报界在一个Bellingcat等调查组织似乎和政府知道一样多的世界中价值的怀疑。但同样，公开来源的情报也使各机构能够对其所知更多信息发表意见，而不会冒着太大风险。在伊拉克战争、国家安全局(NSA)的大规模信息收集能力曝光，以及特朗普关于情报界和其他“深层政府”损害了他的总统职位的说法导致公众对政府问责制的需求增长之后，推动透明度也是出于这个动机。其论点是，披露可以重建公众对美国情报界的信任，部分原因是通过证明其价值。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The most common criticism of disclosures is that they jeopardize
        intelligence sources and methods. If officials in a targeted regime know
        what the U.S. government knows about them, they can sometimes work
        backward to discover the source of that information—whether it be a
        tapped phone line, a cyber-exploit, or a member of the inner circle.
        They might shut down that channel, feed disinformation into it, or, in
        the case of human intelligence, arrest or harm the source. Some
        disclosures have undoubtedly led to a subsequent loss of intelligence.
        The Kennedy administration’s sharing of U-2 photographs of Cuba
        accomplished its intended statecraft goal but also revealed to the world
        for the first time just how sophisticated U.S. aerial surveillance was.
        Afterward, U.S. adversaries learned to better camouflage sensitive sites
        and improved their high-altitude air defense systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        对情报披露最常见的批评是，它们会危及情报来源和方法。如果被针对的政权知道美国政府掌握了哪些关于他们的信息，他们有时就能逆向推导出这些信息的来源——无论是被监听的电话线、网络攻击，还是内部圈子中的某个人。他们可能会关闭这一情报渠道，向这一渠道输入假情报，或者在涉及人力情报时，逮捕或伤害情报来源。有些情报披露无疑导致了情报工作的损失。肯尼迪政府分享的U-2飞机拍摄的古巴照片达成了其外交政策目标，但也第一次向世界展示了美国空中监视技术的高超。之后，美国的对手学会了更好地伪装敏感地点，改进了高空防御系统。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        But the intelligence community is acutely aware of these risks and works
        to mitigate them. Administrations have tended to declassify broad
        analytic judgments that carry little risk to sources and methods,
        leaving out the sensitive intelligence nuggets that could allow the
        source to be identified. The intelligence community, for its part, is
        not shy about standing firm and refusing a policy request for a
        particular disclosure when the risks are just too high. One of us,
        Morell, was involved in declassifying information for Powell’s
        presentation to the UN Security Council; concerned about sources and
        methods, the CIA denied some of Powell’s (and the White House’s)
        requests for declassification.
      </p>
      <p>
        但情报界对这些风险有着敏锐的认识，并努力将它们降至最低。政府往往会解密那些对情报来源和方法几乎不构成威胁的宽泛分析判断，而不会泄露可能暴露情报来源的敏感情报细节。情报机构在认为风险过高时，也不会不好意思拒绝政策制定者关于披露特定信息的要求。莫雷尔曾参与为鲍威尔在联合国安理会的演讲解密工作;出于对情报来源和方法的担忧，中情局拒绝了鲍威尔（以及白宫）的一些解密要求。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Less well understood are the subtler risks to sources and methods. One
        is that human sources will get skittish about divulging information, no
        matter what their handlers promise in terms of security or reward. Many
        CIA case officers—including one of us, Gioe—have had the experience of
        listening to their assets express grave concern about the growing volume
        of intelligence that has gone public, whether through an illegal mass
        leak or an authorized disclosure, and ask if the information they
        provide might go public, too. Some assets have even walked away in the
        aftermath of prominent leaks or disclosures. And it is impossible to
        calculate how many would-be assets have changed their mind as a result
        of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        对情报来源和方法的更微妙风险，人们的理解就不太充分了。其中一种风险是，不管情报人员许诺了多高的安全保护或报酬，人类情报来源都不再愿意透露信息。中情局很多特工（包括本文作者之一乔伊）都有过这样的经历：他们的情报线人对越来越多的情报被公之于众表示严重关切——不管是非法的大规模泄密还是授权披露，并询问他们提供的信息是否也可能公开。有些线人在重大泄密事件后干脆一走了之。而有多少潜在线人因此而改变主意，这根本无法计算。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Another risk to sources and methods is that authorized disclosures could
        result in more unauthorized ones by raising questions about just how
        appropriate it was to classify something in the first place. It can be
        perfectly reasonable to conclude that the national security benefits of
        a given disclosure outweigh the risks. Still, the nuances of such
        judgment calls could be glossed over by leakers, who may see coordinated
        and authorized disclosures as justification or cover for their own
        reckless revelations. Snowden, for instance, complained in his
        autobiography, “It is rare for even a day to go by in which some
        ‘unnamed’ or ‘anonymous’ senior government official does not leak, by
        way of a hint or tip to a journalist, some classified item that advances
        their own agenda or the efforts of their agency or party.” In other
        words, if government officials can release intelligence when it suits
        them, why can’t anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
        对情报来源和方法的另一个风险是，授权披露可能会引发更多未经授权的披露，因为人们会质疑最初将某些内容定为机密是否合适。完全有理由认为，某一披露带来的国家安全利益超过了风险。然而，泄密者可能会忽略这类判断的细微之处，他们可能将协调一致且经过授权的披露视为自己轻率泄露的借口或掩护。例如，斯诺登在其自传中抱怨称，“往往很少有一天会过去，而没有一些‘匿名’或‘未具名’的政府高官向记者透露一点小道消息或提示，泄露一些符合他们自己、其部门或政党的议程的机密内容。”换言之，如果政府官员觉得情报适合发布，为什么其他人不可以？
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A separate risk is that some of the information released turns out to be
        wrong, damaging the reputation of the intelligence community. Although
        intelligence agencies were right about Russia’s intention to invade
        Ukraine—even getting the timing right—such high accuracy is not the
        norm. (Indeed, they were wrong to predict that the Ukrainians wouldn’t
        last long in battle, a judgment that the White House almost certainly
        never wished would go public but ended up leaking anyway.) Despite an
        annual budget of around $100 billion, the U.S. intelligence community
        does not have a crystal ball and cannot supply evidence fit for a
        courtroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        另一个风险是，发布的一些信息后来被证明是错误的，从而损害情报界的地位。虽然情报机构关于俄罗斯意图入侵乌克兰的评估是正确的——甚至在时间点上也对了——但如此高的准确性并非常态。(事实上，他们曾预测乌克兰军队在战斗中坚持不了多久，这是白宫肯定不希望公之于众，但最终还是泄露出去的判断。)尽管美国情报界的年度预算高达1000亿美元，但它并没有水晶球，也无法提供能在法庭上站得住脚的证据。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        For one thing, intelligence on almost any issue is by nature imperfect
        and fragmentary; adversaries go to great lengths to protect the
        information the United States is after and, in some cases, are actively
        deceiving Washington. For another thing, intelligence is dynamic. During
        the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, for instance, the
        intelligence community was continually revising its assessments of the
        Afghan government’s ability to resist the Taliban. Critics claimed that
        the chaotic exit was partly the result of intelligence agencies’ failure
        to predict the Taliban’s swift victory. That may be true, but the
        situation was changing by the hour, and it is inherently hard to predict
        if or when an unstable system will collapse. Intelligence failures
        happen for any number of reasons, legitimate and otherwise, but when
        they do occur, the reputation of the intelligence community gets dented.
        In a world of routine strategic downgrades, it should expect some dents.
      </p>
      <p>
        首先，几乎任何问题的情报本质上都是不完整且支离破碎的；对手会竭尽全力保护美国想要获得的信息，有些时候，他们还会主动误导华盛顿。其次，情报是动态的。例如，在2021年美国从阿富汗撤军期间，情报界不断修正其对阿富汗政府抵御塔利班能力的评估。批评者称，混乱的退出在一定程度上是因为情报机构未能预测到塔利班会迅速获胜。这可能是真的，但形势每小时都在变化，不稳定体系何时（或是否会）崩溃本就很难预测。情报失误可能出于各种有理有据的原因，也可能出于其他原因，但一旦发生，情报界声誉就会受损。在一个战略信誉常规性受损的世界中，它应该对此有所预期。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The greatest risk with disclosures is the politicization of
        intelligence. In its most benign form, politicization takes the form of
        releasing accurate but incomplete information. Since the point of
        disclosures is to advance an administration’s policy, it is only natural
        that officials will select the intelligence that does so and keep
        classified any intelligence to the contrary. (When the Biden
        administration released an estimate of Russian casualties in Ukraine, it
        notably remained mum on the Ukrainians’ own high losses.) This
        preference is acceptable when trying to influence a foreign adversary,
        but not when the audience is the American people. Informing citizens is
        a laudable, apolitical act; trying to shape their views by
        cherry-picking intelligence is not. In the lead-up to the Iraq war,
        Tenet fielded competing requests from members of Congress to declassify
        only those portions of intelligence assessments that buttressed a
        particular argument. One camp, for example, wanted to release a judgment
        that Saddam was unlikely to initiate a terrorist attack against the
        United States, whereas another wanted to release one that Saddam was
        likely to use weapons of mass destruction if he felt cornered. Tenet did
        the right thing by declassifying both judgments.
      </p>
      <p>
        公开情报的最大风险是情报政治化。政治化最无害的形式是发布准确但不完整的信息。由于公开情报的目的是推进政府政策，官员们自然会选择支持其政策的情报，并将任何相反的情报列为机密，也就不足为奇了（当拜登政府公布俄罗斯在乌克兰的损失估计时，它没有提及乌克兰方面同样惨重的损失）。在试图影响外国对手时，这种偏好是可以接受的；但在面向美国民众时就不应该了。向公民通报情况是一种可敬的、非政治性的行为；而通过选择性地公开情报来塑造他们的观点则是不可接受的。在伊拉克战争爆发前，滕内特应国会议员的要求，只解密那些支持特定论点的情报评估部分。例如，一方希望公开萨达姆不太可能对美国发起恐怖袭击的判断，而另一方则希望公开如果觉得陷入绝境，萨达姆可能会使用大规模杀伤性武器的判断。滕内特做对了，他解密了这两个判断。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        In the more egregious form of politicization, policymakers actively
        misrepresent the intelligence they disclose or stake a position beyond
        what it can support. This has happened too frequently to dismiss it as a
        minimal risk. In 1964, for example, President Lyndon Johnson used a
        confrontation between U.S. and North Vietnamese naval forces in the Gulf
        of Tonkin to push Congress to grant him more power in prosecuting the
        Vietnam War. Although there had been just one incident, in a speech to
        the American people, Johnson claimed that there were two—deliberately
        going well beyond what ambiguous intelligence reports had suggested. In
        the Bush administration, several senior officials, intent on making a
        stronger case for invading Iraq, publicly stated that Saddam’s regime
        had an ongoing relationship with al Qaeda—the exact opposite of what the
        CIA had concluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        在更为恶劣的政治操纵中，决策者会故意曲解他们公开的情报，或者提出超出情报支持范围的立场。这种做法已经发生过太多次，不能说它只是一个小风险。例如，在1964年，林登·约翰逊总统利用美国和北越海军在东京湾的冲突，促使国会授权他在发动越南战争上拥有更大权力。尽管事实上只发生了一起事件，但约翰逊在对全国发表讲话时声称发生了两起——故意远远超出了含糊的情报报告所暗示的内容。在布什政府中，一些高级官员为了强化入侵伊拉克的理由，公开表示萨达姆政权与基地组织存在持续联系——这与中情局的结论完全相反。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Amid these cautionary tales, one historical example offers a model for
        disclosure: the Bush administration’s 2008 revelations about a Syrian
        nuclear reactor, apparently built with North Korean help, that an
        Israeli airstrike had leveled a year before. The disclosure was intended
        to strengthen efforts to persuade the North Koreans to provide a full
        accounting of their nuclear weapons activity and efforts to end Iran’s
        uranium enrichment activities. In a declassified briefing to reporters,
        CIA Director Michael Hayden outlined the intelligence surrounding the
        discovery, making it clear what the intelligence community knew and
        didn’t know, as well as how confident it was about its judgments. He
        said that analysts had “high confidence” that the building destroyed by
        Israel was indeed a nuclear reactor, “medium confidence” that North
        Koreans had assisted in building it, and only “low confidence” that it
        was part of a Syrian nuclear weapons program. The last caveat was the
        kind that policymakers typically want to strip out, but Hayden wisely
        put it in. His specificity in connecting each judgment to a
        corresponding confidence level made it harder for anyone to politicize
        the information.
      </p>
      <p>
        在所有这些警示故事中，有一个历史先例可以作为公开的典范：布什政府2008年透露，叙利亚一座似乎在朝鲜帮助下建造的核反应堆在一年前遭到以色列空军摧毁。这一公开的目的是加强努力，说服朝鲜全面交代其核武器活动，并结束伊朗的铀浓缩活动。中央情报局局长迈克尔·海登(Michael
        Hayden)在一个解密的记者吹风会上概述了有关发现的证据，清楚地说明情报界知道什么、不知道什么，以及对各项判断有多大的把握。他说，分析人士“有高度信心”认为以色列摧毁的建筑是一座核反应堆，“中等信心”认为朝鲜曾协助建造它，但对它属于叙利亚核武器计划只有“低度信心”。最后一个保留意见是政策制定者通常想要剔除的那种，但海登明智地加上了。他将每个判断与相应的把握程度相对应的细致做法，使得任何人难以出于政治目的利用这些信息。

        The risks from strategic downgrades are real and, given their
        accelerating use, growing. The decision to disclose intelligence is a
        policy call, and in making it, officials have to strike a delicate
        balance, supporting a given policy goal while protecting sources and
        methods and maintaining analytical integrity. As Jon Finer, Biden’s
        deputy national security adviser, has observed, strategic downgrades
        “must be wielded carefully within strict parameters and oversight.” So
        what should those guardrails be?
      </p>
      <p>
        战略降级的风险是真实存在的，而且鉴于其使用的增加，这些风险还在上升。情报的披露是一个政策决定，在做出这一决定时，官员们必须谨慎权衡，既要支持特定的政策目标，又要保护情报来源和方法，维护分析的完整性。正如拜登的国家安全副顾问乔恩·菲纳所指出的，战略降级“必须在严格的参数和监督下谨慎使用”。那么，应该有哪些保障措施呢？
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        First, any disclosure should pose little threat to intelligence sources
        or methods—a finding that must reflect the consensus of the intelligence
        community. The decision to disclose should be made by the director of
        national intelligence and only after a full consideration of the risks
        to sources and methods. Disclosures that do reveal sources are usually a
        judgment call, but a tie shouldn’t go to the policy runner. One rule of
        thumb is to release analytical judgments but not the underlying raw
        intelligence on which they are based. This is what the Obama
        administration did with the intelligence community’s report about
        Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. This approach
        represents a sort of halfway house for disclosure, but of course it will
        not satisfy those skeptics who understandably wish to see the underlying
        evidence before believing the intelligence community’s conclusions.
        Nevertheless, for many, even all the information would not be enough,
        and in any case, the imperative must be to protect sources and methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        首先，任何解密行为对情报来源和手段的威胁应当微乎其微——这一结论必须获得情报界的一致同意。解密决定应由国家情报总监在全面考虑危害情报来源和手段的风险之后做出。暴露情报来源通常是出于判断，但这种情况下不应让政策制定者说了算。一条经验法则是公开分析判断，但不公开这些判断所基于的原始情报。奥巴马政府在公布情报界有关俄罗斯干预2016年美国总统大选的报告时就是这样做的。这一做法在公开问题上算是一个折中方案。当然，这无法满足那些希望在看到原始证据后再相信情报机构结论的合理怀疑者。然而，就算情报全都公之于众，也会有人觉得不够，无论如何，保护情报来源和手段至关重要。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Second, judgments released publicly should have a high likelihood of
        being correct. If they turn out to be wrong, the intelligence
        community’s reputation will suffer and the effectiveness of future
        disclosures will be undermined, since there would be a historical basis
        to doubt them. One remedy would be to release only high-confidence
        judgments. In 2023, Burns signaled that he had done just that when he
        said he was “confident” that Chinese leaders were considering providing
        Russia with lethal aid, a word choice that suggested analysts believed
        there was a high likelihood their judgment was correct. Another option
        would be to follow Hayden’s example and disclose intelligence of various
        levels of confidence but make clear which conclusions enjoy which level.

        第二，公开发布的判断应该有很高的可能性是正确的。如果他们被证明是错误的，情报机构的声誉将受到损害，未来披露的有效性将受到损害，因为有历史依据来怀疑他们。一种补救办法是只公布高可信度的判断。伯恩斯在2023年表示，他就是这么做的，当时他说，他“有信心”中国领导人正在考虑向俄罗斯提供致命援助，这一措辞表明，分析人士认为，他们的判断很可能是正确的。另一种选择是效仿海登的例子，公开不同级别的情报，但要明确哪些结论适用于哪个级别。

        Third, in a world of disinformation and spin, the release of
        intelligence must represent the truth or, more precisely, what the
        intelligence community assesses to be true. Although it may be tempting
        to embed disinformation in a disclosure, that line should never be
        crossed. Nor should officials attempt to spin the intelligence in any
        way to create a misleading impression. And crucial caveats should always
        be included, since withholding them creates the illusion of certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        第三，在一个充斥着假消息和公关手段的世界里，情报的发布必须代表事实，或者更准确地说，代表情报界认为的事实。尽管在信息披露中植入假消息可能很有诱惑力，但这条红线决不能逾越。官员们也不应试图以任何方式对情报进行加工，从而产生误导性的印象。而且，重要的是要给出保留意见，因为不这样做会给人一种确定无疑的假象。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Fourth, a disclosure should have to pass a common-sense test: that there
        be a reasonable chance it will have the intended effect. Disclosures
        have a mixed record and are probably less successful than officials
        believe. One requirement for success is that a strategic downgrade be
        connected to an overarching strategy involving the rest of the U.S.
        government; if it isn’t, its chances of working are markedly reduced.
        The Biden administration’s disclosures about the impending invasion of
        Ukraine, for instance, had some positive effect, but they could not
        compensate for years of poor policies, such as the failure to impose
        tough sanctions or give Kyiv enough military aid after Putin seized
        Crimea.
      </p>
      <p>
        其次，公开披露必须通过常识检验：即它有可能产生预期的效果。公开披露的过往记录参差不齐，其效果可能没有官员们认为的那么好。成功的前提是降级策略必须与涉及美国政府其他部门的总体战略相联系；如果没有，其成功的机会就会大打折扣。例如，拜登政府对俄罗斯即将入侵乌克兰的披露产生了一些积极影响，但无法抵消多年糟糕政策的影响，比如在普京占领克里米亚后没有实施严厉制裁，也没有给予基辅足够的军事援助。

      <p>
        Although bureaucratic rules are rarely the best solution to real-world
        problems, there is one that would help here. The director of national
        intelligence should issue an intelligence community directive (the
        intelligence community’s equivalent of an executive order) stipulating
        that a disclosure can be made only after she has signed a memorandum
        that addresses all the guardrails. This requirement would not only
        instill discipline but also create a record of important decisions. The
        office of the director of national intelligence could then develop an
        internal dataset—trackable over time and available to her successors—to
        assess the short- and long-term effects of disclosures.
      </p>
      <p>
        诚然，官僚规章很少是解决现实世界问题的最佳办法，但这里有一个办法可以一试。国家情报总监应发布一项情报界指令（相当于总统行政令），规定只有在她签署了一份考虑了所有防范措施的备忘录之后，才能公开信息。这一要求不仅会带来纪律，还会形成重要决策的记录。然后，国家情报总监办公室可以建立一个内部数据库，可随时追踪，并可供其继任者使用，以评估公开信息的短期和长期影响。

        The conundrum of strategic downgrades is but one of many challenges
        facing the U.S. intelligence community. The list is long: how to recruit
        spies in a world of ubiquitous technical surveillance, how to collect
        signals intelligence in a world of decentralized telecommunications and
        computing, how to sift through mountains of data in a world of
        open-source information, and how to hire and retain the best and the
        brightest in a world of declining trust in government. And all these
        difficulties are set against the backdrop of great-power competition,
        with China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries working every day
        to threaten the United States’ democracy, prosperity, and security.

        如何在无处不在的技术监视环境中招募间谍？
        如何在一个去中心化的电信和计算世界中收集信号情报？
        如何在一个开放源信息世界中筛选海量数据？
        如何在一个对政府不信任日益增强的世界中招聘并留住最优秀和最聪明的人才？
        在所有这些挑战背后，还存在着大国竞争的背景，中国、俄罗斯和其他威权国家每天都试图威胁美国的民主、繁荣与安全。

        Officials outside intelligence agencies, for their part, generally do
        not approach disclosures with the same caution as the people serving
        inside them. Policymakers’ natural confidence and enviable optimism
        about the efficacy of their own actions may invite them to focus on the
        upsides of disclosures while ignoring or rationalizing away the dangers.
        Their desire to maximize the policy utility of secret intelligence may
        lead them to resist efforts to add new restraints to the disclosure
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        而情报机构之外的官员在处理信息公开时，往往不像内部人那么谨慎。政策制定者天性自信，对自己行动功效抱有可喜的乐观态度，这可能使他们只看到信息公开的好处，而忽视或为公开带来的危险辩解。他们希望充分利用秘密情报的政策效用，因此可能会抵制为信息公开流程增设新限制的努力。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Given all these pressures, it would be tempting for policymakers and
        intelligence practitioners alike to throw up their hands and decide to
        manage strategic declassification in an ad hoc way. But that would be a
        mistake. The point of no return has been passed, and intelligence is
        being released faster than norms can be created. If the process for
        disclosures is not handled with utmost care, the United States could
        diminish the unparalleled advantage in statecraft and national security
        it derives from a crucial pillar of American power: the U.S.
        intelligence community.
      </p>
      <p>
        面对所有这些压力，政策制定者和情报官员可能会感到无助，从而选择以零敲碎打的方式应对战略解密。但那将是一个错误。现在已没有回头路可走：信息的披露速度超过了规则的形成速度。如果处理不当，美国可能会削弱其从美国情报界这一美国力量的关键支柱中获得的无与伦比的外交和国家安全优势。
