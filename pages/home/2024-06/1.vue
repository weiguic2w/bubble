        The Israel-Hamas war—and the possibility that it may explode into a
        wider conflagration—has upended the determined efforts of three U.S.
        presidents to pivot American resources and focus away from the Middle
        East. Immediately after Hamas’s October 7 attack, U.S. President Joe
        Biden moved quickly to support Israel, a critical American ally, and
        deter the expansion of hostilities. But as of this writing, the conflict
        has become a hellish impasse. The security imperatives driving the war
        command wide support among the Israeli public, yet months of intense
        Israeli operations have failed to eliminate Hamas, killed tens of
        thousands of Palestinian civilians, and precipitated a humanitarian
        catastrophe in the Gaza Strip. And as the crisis expands, so, too, have
        the United States’ engagements in the Middle East. In the months after
        October 7, Washington delivered aid shipments to besieged Gazans,
        launched military operations to protect maritime transit, worked to
        contain the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, strove to degrade the
        capabilities of other disruptive militias from Iraq to Yemen, and
        pursued ambitious diplomatic initiatives to foster the normalization of
        relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

        以色列和哈马斯之间的战争——以及它可能进一步升级为更大规模冲突的可能性——已经颠覆了三位美国总统竭力将美国的资源和注意力从中东转移开来的努力。在10月7日哈马斯发动袭击后，美国总统乔·拜登迅速采取行动，支持关键盟友以色列，并遏制敌对行动的扩大。但就目前而言，冲突已成为一场可怕的僵局。推动这场战争的安全考量在以色列公众中得到了广泛支持，但数月的高强度军事行动未能消灭哈马斯，却已造成成千上万巴勒斯坦平民死亡，并在加沙地带引发了人道主义危机。随着危机的升级，美国在中东的介入也在增加。10月7日之后的几个月里，华盛顿向被围困的加沙人提供了援助，发起军事行动以保护海上交通，努力遏制黎巴嫩什叶派民兵真主党，试图削弱从伊拉克到也门的其他破坏性民兵组织的能力，并推行雄心勃勃的外交倡议，以促进以色列和沙特阿拉伯之间的关系正常化。

        Reengaging with the Middle East presents risks for Biden, especially as
        he campaigns for reelection against his predecessor, Donald Trump, whose
        critiques of the human and economic costs of America’s wars in Iraq and
        Afghanistan resonated with voters and boosted his 2016 presidential
        campaign. In a Quinnipiac poll conducted three weeks after Hamas’s
        attack, an overwhelming 84 percent of Americans expressed concern that
        the United States could be drawn into direct military involvement in the
        Middle East conflict, and only one in five respondents to a February
        2024 Pew survey agreed that the United States should make a “major”
        diplomatic push to end the Israel-Hamas war. But the risks posed by
        timidity are even greater. One regional actor particularly benefits from
        Washington’s hesitation or disengagement: the Islamic Republic of Iran.
        In fact, the quagmire in the Middle East presents an opportunity for a
        breakthrough in a four-decade strategy by Tehran to debilitate one of
        its foremost regional adversaries, Israel—and to humiliate the United
        States and drastically diminish its influence in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        重新投入中东事务对拜登来说有风险，尤其是考虑到他要面对的2024年大选对手是他的前任唐纳德·特朗普。特朗普曾对美国在伊拉克和阿富汗战争中付出的人力和经济代价提出批评，这得到了很多选民的共鸣，也助力了他2016年的总统竞选。在哈马斯发动袭击三周后，昆尼皮亚克大学进行的一项民调显示，84%的美国人担心美国会被拖入中东冲突的直接军事行动中。而在2024年2月的皮尤研究中心民调中，只有五分之一的受访者认为美国应该“大力”推动以巴停战。但更为危险的是犹豫不决。华盛顿的迟疑或脱离对该地区的一个行为体尤其有利：伊朗伊斯兰共和国。事实上，中东僵局为德黑兰提供了一个机会，可以实现其四十年来削弱主要地区对手以色列的战略目标——同时羞辱美国，并大幅降低其在该地区的影响力。

        Iran’s Islamic regime aimed to inspire copycat religious uprisings after
        its own 1979 revolution, and to many observers, it may appear to have
        failed. Indeed, the conventional wisdom in Washington and elsewhere has
        often held that Iran has become contained, even isolated. But this was
        never true. Instead, Tehran developed a calculated strategy to empower
        proxy militias and to influence operations in its neighborhood while
        maintaining plausible deniability—a scheme whose canniness was
        vindicated by the devastating scope of Hamas’s assault and subsequent
        attacks by Iranian-affiliated militias in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        伊朗伊斯兰共和国在1979年革命后试图煽动更多宗教起义，而对许多人来说，这些起义似乎都失败了。事实上，华盛顿和其他地方的普遍看法往往是，伊朗已经被遏制，甚至被孤立。但事实从来不是这样的。相反，德黑兰发展出了一种精心设计的战略：通过扶植代理人武装、在地区内进行影响力行动，同时保持可以推卸的责任——这一策略的狡猾之处，在哈马斯的猛烈攻击以及随后伊拉克、黎巴嫩和也门亲伊朗民兵的袭击中得到了证明。

        The post–October 7 strategic landscape in the Middle East is one that
        was largely created by Iran and that plays to its strengths. Tehran sees
        opportunity in chaos. Iranian leaders are exploiting and escalating the
        war in Gaza to elevate their regime’s stature, weaken and delegitimize
        Israel, undermine U.S. interests, and further shape the regional order
        in their favor. The truth is that the Islamic Republic is now in a
        better position than ever to dominate the Middle East, including by
        attaining the ability to disrupt shipping at multiple critical
        chokepoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        10·7之后的中东战略格局在很大程度上是伊朗塑造的，而且有利于伊朗发挥其优势。德黑兰从混乱中看到了机遇。伊朗领导人正利用并加剧加沙战争，以提升其政权的地位、削弱和非合法化以色列、损害美国利益，并进一步按照自己的意愿塑造地区秩序。事实上，伊斯兰共和国如今比以往任何时候都更有能力主宰中东，包括获得在多个关键水道干扰航运的能力。

        Left unchecked, the dramatic expansion of Iran’s influence would have a
        catastrophic impact on Israel, the wider region, and the global economy.
        To disrupt this amplification of Iranian power, Biden urgently needs to
        articulate and then implement a clear strategy to protect Palestinian
        civilians from bearing the brunt of Israel’s military operations,
        counter Iran’s corrosive war-by-proxy strategy, and blunt the
        capabilities of Tehran’s accomplices. Achieving these goals will require
        a tricky set of moves by Washington, and Americans are weary of the
        military, economic, and human toll of their country’s commitments in the
        Middle East. But no world power other than the United States has the
        military and diplomatic capacity to frustrate Iran’s most destructive
        ambitions by managing the spiraling conflict between Israel and Hamas
        and containing its most devastating long-term consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        任由伊朗影响力的急剧上升不受阻碍，对以色列、更广泛的地区以及全球经济来说，后果将是灾难性的。为了打破这种伊朗实力的增强，拜登迫切需要阐明并实施一项明确的战略，以保护巴勒斯坦平民免受以色列军事行动的冲击，抵制伊朗代理人战争的腐蚀性影响，并削弱德黑兰同伙的能力。实现这些目标将需要华盛顿采取一系列微妙的举措，而美国人对他们国家在中东承诺所付出的军事、经济和人力代价感到疲惫。但除了美国之外，没有其他世界大国拥有通过管理以色列与哈马斯之间不断升级的冲突、遏制其最严重的长期后果来挫败伊朗最具破坏性野心的军事和外交能力。

      <h3>CHAOS THEORY</h3>
      <h3>混沌理論</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Since Hamas’s 2007 takeover of Gaza, Iran has served as the group’s
        primary patron. Tehran proffered money, materiel, and other support that
        made the October 7 attack possible, including military technologies,
        intelligence, and as much as $300 million per year in financial
        assistance. It provided drones and rockets as well as infrastructure and
        training to help Hamas build its own weapons—weapons Hamas used to
        continue striking Israel for several months after the initial attack. 
      </p>
      <p>
        自2007年哈马斯控制加沙以来，伊朗一直是该组织的主要赞助者。德黑兰提供资金、物资和其他支持，使得10月7日的袭击成为可能，包括军事技术、情报以及每年高达3亿美元的财政援助。它还提供无人机和火箭，以及帮助哈马斯建立自己武器库的基础设施和培训。在最初的袭击之后几个月里，哈马斯一直用这些武器袭击以色列。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        After October 7, Iranian-backed militias also quickly ramped up hostile
        activities targeting Israeli and U.S. forces in the region. These
        assaults have caused well over a hundred casualties among U.S. service
        members. The Houthis, the Iranian-backed armed group ruling much of
        Yemen’s population—have attacked ships sailing in the Red Sea, causing
        transit through the Suez Canal to fall by 50 percent in the first two
        months of 2024. According to Congressional testimony in March by General
        Michael Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, the escalation in strikes
        by Iran’s allies and subsequent U.S. military responses have emboldened
        terrorist organizations not aligned with Tehran, prompting an uptick in
        attacks by groups such as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
        10月7日之后，伊朗支持的民兵也迅速增加针对以色列和美国在该地区部队的敌对行动，造成一百多名美国军人伤亡。控制着也门大部分人口的、由伊朗支持的胡塞武装袭击了红海上的船只，导致2024年前两个月通过苏伊士运河的航运量减少50%。据美国中央司令部司令迈克尔·库里拉将军3月在国会作证称，伊朗盟友的袭击升级和随后的美国军事回应鼓舞了与德黑兰无关的恐怖组织，导致伊斯兰国（ISIS）等团体的袭击增加。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Iran also made explicit moves to raise its diplomatic profile in the
        wake of October 7. Days after Hamas’s attack, Iranian President Ebrahim
        Raisi spoke directly by phone for the first time with the Saudi crown
        prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and in November, he participated in a
        regional summit in Riyadh. Other Iranian officials, such as Foreign
        Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, have ricocheted around the region and
        beyond, seeking to position their country as a trusted mediator even as
        the regime maintains its support for Hamas.
      </p>
      <p>
        伊朗也采取了明确措施，在10月7日之后提升其外交影响力。哈马斯发动袭击几天后，伊朗总统莱希与沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼首次直接通电话，11月，他参加了在利雅得举行的地区峰会。其他伊朗官员，如外长阿米尔-阿卜杜拉希扬，穿梭于该地区甚至更远的地方，试图将伊朗定位为一个可靠的调解者，尽管该政权继续支持哈马斯。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        None of these developments are merely the result of Iran’s glimpsing new
        openings in turmoil and making opportunistic, impulsive moves. They are
        the product of a time-tested playbook. From the inception of the Islamic
        Republic, Iran’s leadership has harbored expansive ambitions. Since
        1979, the country has viewed chaos and volatility, whether at home or
        nearby, as an opportunity to advance its interests and influence. Even
        Iraq’s 1980 invasion of Iran worked to the fledgling theocracy’s
        advantage by rallying internal support for the new order in Tehran,
        providing the occasion to build a strong domestic defense industry, and
        enabling the regime to survive its infancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        这些事态发展并非伊朗见缝插针、冲动行事的结果。它们遵循着久经考验的剧本。从伊斯兰共和国诞生之初，伊朗领导人就抱有雄心壮志。自1979年起，该国就将动乱和不稳定——无论国内还是周边——视为推进其利益和影响力的机遇。就连1980年伊拉克对伊朗的入侵也在一定程度上有利于脆弱的神权政体：它为德黑兰的新秩序争取到了国内支持，为发展强大的国防工业提供了借口，并帮助政权度过了襁褓期。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Tehran has used successive conflagrations in its neighborhood to
        strengthen its position. Historically, some of the most valuable
        openings have come as a result of missteps by Washington and its
        partners in the region, such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. That
        conflict, which brought 150,000 U.S. troops to Iran’s doorstep, quickly
        broke in Tehran’s favor. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the Iranian
        leadership’s most existential threat, was deposed, and his regime was
        replaced by a weak state led by disaffected Shiites with existing ties
        to Tehran. Iran made the most of other moments of regional chaos in the
        years that followed. Beginning in 2013, the country’s Islamic
        Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) worked with its primary surrogate,
        Hezbollah, to mobilize brigades of Afghan and Pakistani Shiites into a
        larger transnational Shiite militia to defend Bashar al-Assad’s
        embattled regime in Syria. Tehran eventually built an effective
        partnership with Russia during the Syrian civil war, which expanded into
        a broader strategic cooperation after Russian President Vladimir Putin
        invaded Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
        德黑兰曾利用周边地区的冲突来巩固自己的地位。历史经验表明，华盛顿及其地区盟友的某些失误反而给伊朗提供了宝贵的机会，比如2003年美国入侵伊拉克。那场战争把15万美军送到了伊朗家门口，却迅速对德黑兰有利。对伊朗领导层构成最大生存威胁的伊拉克总统萨达姆·侯赛因被推翻，取而代之的是一个由对德黑兰抱有好感的什叶派不满分子领导的虚弱政府。在随后的几年里，伊朗又利用了地区动荡的其他时机。从2013年开始，伊斯兰革命卫队(IRGC)与其主要代理人真主党合作，动员阿富汗和巴基斯坦什叶派民兵组成一支更大的跨国什叶派民兵组织，以保卫叙利亚巴沙尔·阿萨德(Bashar
        al-Assad)政权。最终，伊朗在叙利亚内战期间与俄罗斯建立了有效伙伴关系，之后随着俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir
        Putin)入侵乌克兰，这一关系扩展为更广泛的战略合作。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A key component of Iran’s strategy in its neighborhood has been the
        cultivation of an “axis of resistance,” a loose network of regional
        militias with discrete organizational structures, overlapping interests,
        and ties to Iran’s security and religious establishments. The Islamic
        Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, maintained that
        exporting the revolution was necessary for its survival, arguing that if
        the theocracy remained “in an enclosed environment” it would “definitely
        face defeat.” Determined to spark a wider wave of Islamist-led upheavals
        against secular monarchies and republics in the Middle East, Khomeini
        and his acolytes developed an infrastructure dedicated to toppling the
        status quo across the Muslim world. During the Islamic Republic’s
        initial two decades in power, its leaders worked with proxy groups in
        the Persian Gulf and elsewhere to help incite a 1981 coup attempt in
        Bahrain, the 1983 bombings of the U.S. Embassy and other American
        interests in Kuwait, a 1985 assassination attempt against Kuwait’s emir,
        incendiary anti-Saudi and anti-American rallies during the annual Muslim
        pilgrimage to Mecca, the 1996 bombing of a U.S. military barracks in
        Saudi Arabia, and other subversive actions against its neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        伊朗地缘战略的一个关键要素是打造一条“抵抗轴心”，这是一个地区民兵网络，各组织结构独立但利益重叠，并与伊朗的安全和宗教机构有联系。伊斯兰共和国的缔造者鲁霍拉·霍梅尼认为，输出革命对革命的存续至关重要，他宣称，如果政教合一制度“处于封闭的环境中”，它“肯定会失败”。为了在中东地区煽动更广泛的伊斯兰主义者领导的针对世俗君主制和共和国的动荡，霍梅尼及其门徒建立了一个致力于颠覆穆斯林世界现状的基础设施。在伊斯兰共和国最初的二十年里，其领导人与波斯湾和其他地区的代理团体合作，策动了1981年巴林政变未遂事件、1983年针对美国驻科威特大使馆等美国利益的爆炸案、1985年针对科威特埃米尔的暗杀企图、每年穆斯林朝圣期间反沙特和反美的示威活动、1996年针对沙特一处美军宿舍的爆炸案，以及其他颠覆邻国的行动。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The revolutionary wave Khomeini hoped for never materialized. Although
        Iranian leaders’ expectations for a wide-scale revolt against the
        existing regional order were disappointed, they would find their
        aspirations validated by the emergence of sympathetic militant groups
        that sought the revolutionary state’s patronage. And the Islamic
        Republic’s early investments yielded a valuable asset that has served as
        a model for its later efforts: Hezbollah. After Israel’s 1982 invasion
        of Lebanon, Iran’s fledgling IRGC began training and coordinating
        Hezbollah, an incipient Shiite armed group. Iran’s assistance
        immediately made Hezbollah more potent: the group mounted a series of
        devastating suicide bombings of French and U.S. government facilities in
        1983 and 1984 in Lebanon, as well as kidnappings, hijackings, and
        violence further afield, such as the bombing of a Jewish community
        center in Argentina in 1994 and the suicide bombing of a bus in Bulgaria
        that killed five Israeli tourists in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        霍梅尼期待的革命浪潮并未出现。虽然伊朗领导人期待的针对现存地区秩序的大范围反抗并未发生，但他们很快看到，寻求革命国家庇护的同情者组成的武装团体纷纷涌现，这证明了他们的愿望是正确的。伊斯兰共和国早期的投入带来了一项宝贵的资产，成为其后来努力的榜样：真主党。1982年以色列入侵黎巴嫩后，伊朗刚刚成立的伊斯兰革命卫队开始训练并协调真主党——一个新兴的什叶派民兵组织。伊朗的支持立竿见影地提高了真主党的实力：1983年和1984年，该组织对黎巴嫩境内的法国和美国设施发动了一系列致命的自杀式袭击，并实施绑架、劫持飞机以及在更远的地方（比如1994年对阿根廷一个犹太人社区中心的爆炸袭击和2012年在保加利亚对一辆载有五名以色列游客的公交车的自杀式袭击）制造暴力事件。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Through its political wing, Hezbollah insinuated itself deep into the
        Lebanese government, installing members in the parliament and the
        cabinet. This political role did not temper the group’s reliance on
        violence: several Hezbollah members were convicted in the 2005
        assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri.
        Despite Israeli and U.S. efforts to eliminate the militia, it maintains
        tens of thousands of active fighters, and with Tehran’s help, has
        amassed an arsenal of some 150,000 mostly short- and medium-range
        rockets and missiles, as well as drones and antitank, antiaircraft, and
        antiship artillery. Tehran continues to provide Hezbollah with $700
        million to $1 billion per year in support, and the group remains the
        paramount social, political, and military actor in Lebanon.
      </p>
      <p>
        其政治翼在黎巴嫩政府中深深植入了自己的势力，安插了议员和部长。这种政治角色并没有削弱该组织对暴力的依赖：数名真主党成员因策划2005年刺杀前总理拉菲克·哈里里而被定罪。尽管以色列和美国试图消灭这支准军事力量，但真主党仍拥有数万名活跃战斗人员，并在德黑兰的帮助下积累了大约15万枚短程和中程火箭弹和导弹，以及无人机、反坦克、防空和反舰炮兵。德黑兰每年向真主党提供7亿至10亿美元的支持，而该组织仍然是黎巴嫩首要的社会、政治和军事力量。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hezbollah has proved extraordinarily useful to Iran. Its head, Sheikh
        Hassan Nasrallah, is one of the few regional power players who openly
        pay homage to Iran’s supreme leader as their organizations’ spiritual
        guide, although Hezbollah no longer espouses its early objective of
        establishing an Islamic state in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s role in driving
        Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon, completed in 2000, earned the
        group brief regional acclaim and enduring domestic legitimacy, and its
        global reach continues to amplify Tehran’s leverage. Since the early
        1990s, it has played a vital role in funneling funds, training, and arms
        from Iran to a variety of other groups, including but hardly limited to
        Hamas.
      </p>
      <p>
        真主党对伊朗来说极为有用。其领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉是少数几位公开尊奉伊朗最高领袖为他们组织精神领袖的地区力量之一，尽管真主党不再坚持其早先在黎巴嫩建立伊斯兰国家的目标。真主党在驱赶以色列离开黎巴嫩南部（2000年全部完成）方面所起的作用为其赢得了短暂的地区声誉和持久的国内合法性，而它的全球影响力继续放大了德黑兰的杠杆作用。自上世纪90年代初以来，它一直在向包括哈马斯在内各类团体输送伊朗的资金、训练和武器方面发挥着重要作用。

      <h3>THE LONG GAME</h3>
      <h3>持久战</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        With its cultivation of Hezbollah as a template, Iran then invested an
        enormous amount of effort and resources in cultivating militant groups
        across the Middle East. The support it has given to Palestinian militant
        groups, especially Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas, paid tremendous
        dividends over subsequent decades, as did its aid to Shiite opponents of
        Saddam in Iraq. These relationships provided the springboard for Iranian
        influence at key turning points for regional stability. In the 1990s,
        PIJ terrorist attacks disrupted the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
        and nudged Israeli politics rightward. After the 2003 U.S.-led invasion
        of Iraq, Tehran’s patronage of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council and the
        Dawa Party, both significant Shiite factions, positioned Iran as the
        most influential player in Iraq’s contentious postwar polity.
      </p>
      <p>
        在利用黎巴嫩真主党作为模板后，伊朗又投入大量精力和资源在整个中东地区扶植激进组织。它对巴勒斯坦武装团体、尤其是巴勒斯坦伊斯兰圣战组织和哈马斯的支持，在随后的几十年里收获了巨大回报；它对伊拉克什叶派反萨达姆力量的支持也是如此。这些关系为伊朗在影响地区稳定的关键时刻发挥作用奠定了基础。上世纪90年代，伊斯兰圣战组织的恐怖袭击破坏了以色列-巴勒斯坦和平进程，推动以色列政治转向右翼。2003年美国领导入侵伊拉克之后，德黑兰对伊斯兰最高伊拉克委员会和达瓦党的支持（这两个都是重要的什叶派派别）使伊朗成为伊拉克战后充满争议的政治格局中最有影响力的外部力量。

        The Syrian civil war elevated Hezbollah’s status to the jewel in the
        crown of the Iranian proxy network. Working closely with the IRGC,
        Hezbollah trained and coordinated the wider network of Iranian-backed
        Shiite militias that flooded into Syria from Afghanistan, Iraq,
        Pakistan, and Yemen. Iran has proved remarkably flexible and pragmatic
        in developing this network, enabling it to align itself with partners
        and surrogates on multiple continents. Sometimes, Tehran uses umbrella
        groups and joint operation rooms to coordinate diverse factions, and at
        other times intentionally fragments existing groups to maintain its
        influence over them. Iran’s money and materiel have long been a central
        dimension of its relationships with individual militias. Increasingly,
        however, Tehran not only transfers finished weaponry but also the means
        for its proxy groups to manufacture and modify weapons independently.

        叙利亚内战提升了真主党在伊朗代理人网络中的地位，使其成为王冠上的明珠。与伊斯兰革命卫队紧密合作，真主党培训并协调了更广泛的什叶派民兵网络，这些民兵从阿富汗、伊拉克、巴基斯坦和也门涌入叙利亚。伊朗在发展这一网络方面表现出惊人的灵活性和务实精神，使自己能够与多个大陆的伙伴和代理人对齐。有时，德黑兰会利用伞状组织和联合行动室来协调不同派别，有时则故意分化现有组织以保持其影响力。长期以来，伊朗的资金和物资一直是它与个别民兵组织关系的核心要素。然而，德黑兰不仅转让成品武器，还转让其代理团体自主制造和改装武器的手段，这种情况正变得日益普遍。

        Iran’s national security establishment sees investing in asymmetric
        warfare as an economical means of gaining leverage against more powerful
        adversaries, especially the United States. Iran’s influence over
        militias has been boosted by the elimination of most of its radical
        competitors in the Middle East. After deep-pocketed dictators such as
        Saddam and Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi were removed from power, the
        Islamic Republic became one of the few regional players possessing the
        interest and the resources to back armed militias.

        伊朗的国家安全机构认为，投资于不对称战争是一种经济手段，可以获得对抗更强大对手的筹码，尤其是美国。伊朗在中东消灭了大多数激进的竞争对手，从而增强了伊朗对民兵组织的影响力。在萨达姆和利比亚的穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲等财大气大的独裁者被赶下台后，伊斯兰共和国成为少数几个有兴趣和资源支持武装民兵的地区国家之一。

        In many respects, the relationship between Iran and its proxies reflects
        shared preferences for autonomy and self-interest. The evolutionary
        nature of Iranian investments in its clients has worked to its
        advantage, enabling the security establishment to sustain partnerships
        of enduring value that can withstand disruptions. For example, even as
        Hamas distanced itself from Iran for several years after the eruption of
        the Syrian civil war, Iran continued to provide the group with residual
        funding, and in time the relationship rebounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        在很多方面，伊朗与其代理人之间的关系反映了双方对自主和自身利益的共同偏好。伊朗对其客户的投入具有演化性质，这对它有利，使安全部门能够维持有价值且能抵御分裂的伙伴关系。例如，即便哈马斯在叙利亚内战爆发后数年与伊朗保持距离，伊朗仍向该组织提供剩余资金，而两国关系最终得以恢复。

        In the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Tehran sought to more
        fully establish itself as a power broker in a region in turmoil. Israel
        waged a determined campaign to blunt Iranian influence by “mowing the
        lawn,” or routinely striking Iranian positions in Syria to disrupt the
        Islamic Republic’s attempt to develop a land bridge to supply Hezbollah
        and its wider network of surrogates. This campaign scored a number of
        tactical successes, yet it does not seem to have had a meaningful
        deterrent impact on Iran and its proxies.
      </p>
      <p>
        美国入侵伊拉克之后，德黑兰寻求在动荡的地区巩固其调解者的地位。以色列则展开坚决行动，通过“割草”（即定期打击叙利亚境内的伊朗阵地，以破坏伊朗建立通往真主党和更广泛代理人网络的陆地走廊的努力），来削弱伊朗的影响力。这一行动取得了一些战术上的成功，但似乎并未对伊朗及其代理人产生有意义的威慑效果。

        The United States, meanwhile, was seeking to deepen its relationship
        with alternative power centers and foster new alignments to counter
        Tehran. From President Bill Clinton’s “dual containment” (which sought
        to isolate both Iran and Iraq while advancing Arab-Israeli peacemaking)
        to President George W. Bush’s “forward strategy for freedom” (which
        focused on advancing democratization in the Middle East and beyond),
        Washington has repeatedly invested in schemes intended to excise
        Iranian-backed violent extremism from the Middle East, to little effect.
        In a November 2023 speech, Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei,
        reflected on these efforts, sneering that Washington had “failed
        completely in trying to create a ‘New Middle East.’” He went on: “Yes,
        the region’s geopolitical map is undergoing a fundamental
        transformation, but not to the benefit of the United States. It is to
        the benefit of the resistance front. Yes, West Asia’s geopolitical map
        has changed—but it has changed in favor of the resistance.”
      </p>
      <p>
        美国则试图强化与地区内其他权力中心的关系，并推动新的联盟以制衡德黑兰。从比尔·克林顿总统的“双重遏制”政策（旨在孤立伊朗和伊拉克，同时推动阿以和解）到乔治·W·布什总统的“自由前进战略”（专注于推动中东乃至更广泛的地区的民主化），华盛顿一再投资于旨在根除伊朗支持的暴力极端主义的计划，但收效甚微。2023年11月，伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊在一次讲话中回顾了这些努力，嘲笑美国试图打造“新中东”的努力“彻底失败”。他接着说：“没错，该地区的地缘政治版图正在发生根本性转变，但这对美国并无益处。得益的是抵抗阵线。没错，西亚的地缘政治版图已经改变——但它朝着有利于抵抗的方向发生了变化。”

        Since October 7, Iran’s leaders have exulted in Israelis’ terror and
        grief and exploited the immense suffering of Palestinian civilians in
        Gaza to further elevate their status as power brokers. The war has
        provided an opening for the Islamic Republic to resume a formal role in
        pan-Muslim and cross-regional consultations. As they often do, Iranian
        leaders have coupled active diplomacy with a show of force intended to

        Attacks by Iran’s surrogate militias pose a devilishly complex challenge
        for Washington and the world. From October 2023 through mid-February
        2024, attacks by Iranian-backed proxies resulted in at least 186
        casualties among U.S. troops serving in the Middle East. These included
        130 traumatic brain injuries, the loss of three army reservists in
        Jordan, and the deaths of two navy SEALs on a mission to interdict
        illicit Iranian weapons off the coast of Somalia.

        Before October 7, the Biden administration had invested considerable
        time, energy, and political capital in a plan to help normalize
        relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a deal would have
        represented a huge breakthrough for both governments and the wider
        region by opening up new economic opportunities and, over time, helping
        marginalize the influence of malign actors, including Tehran and its
        proxies. Biden’s effort to achieve an Israeli-Saudi normalization deal
        was the most recent component of a long American campaign to strengthen
        cooperation between self-described moderate regional actors. The
        normalization talks built on the success of the 2020 Abraham Accords,
        which paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations
        between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates
        and opened unprecedented opportunities for bilateral trade, military
        cooperation, and people-to-people engagement. The opening with Riyadh
        would have boosted this trend, putting Iran on the back foot even as it
        strove to secure its own rapprochement with Riyadh.

        在10月7日之前，拜登政府花了相当多的时间、精力和政治资本来推动一项帮助以色列与沙特阿拉伯实现关系正常化的计划。这一协议对两国政府和整个地区来说都将是巨大的突破，将开启新的经济机会，并最终削弱包括德黑兰及其代理人在内的恶意行为者的影响力。拜登推动以沙两国实现关系正常化的努力是美国长期努力的最新组成部分，目的是加强所谓温和区域行为体之间的合作。这些正常化谈判是2020年亚伯拉罕协议(Abraham
        Accords)取得成功的基础上进行的，后者为以色列与巴林、摩洛哥、苏丹和阿联酋建立外交关系铺平了道路，开启了双边贸易、军事合作和人文交流的前所未有机会。与利雅得的接触将会增强这一趋势，使伊朗在寻求自己与利雅得和解的同时陷入被动。

        The case for establishing full diplomatic ties between Israel and Saudi
        Arabia remains compelling. But the Israel-Hamas war added staggering
        complexities to what was already going to be a historically ambitious
        undertaking. For many Israelis in and outside of government, Hamas’s
        horrific attack only reinforced the conviction that Palestinian
        sovereignty presents an unacceptable security threat. Israel’s
        subsequent operations in Gaza, however, triggered new Saudi demands for
        a meaningful effort to redress Palestinian suffering. And the U.S.
        contribution to the proposed rapprochement—security commitments to Saudi
        Arabia and investments in the kingdom’s civil nuclear
        infrastructure—requires buy-in from American lawmakers that has become
        harder to secure amid concerns that an escalation of the Israel-Hamas
        war could draw U.S. forces directly into another Middle East conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        以沙建交的理由仍然充分。但以色列和哈马斯之间的战争给原本就雄心勃勃的历史性努力增添了令人难以招架的复杂因素。对许多以色列人(无论是在政府内还是在政府外)来说，哈马斯的残暴袭击进一步坚定了他们的信念：巴勒斯坦主权构成不可接受的安全威胁。然而，随后以色列在加沙地带采取的行动引发了沙特方面的新要求，即必须做出有意义的努力来解决巴勒斯坦人的苦难。而美国为提议中的和解所要付出的代价——对沙特的安全承诺以及对该国民用核基础设施的投资——需要获得美国议员的支持，而随着人们担心以哈冲突升级可能直接将美军卷入另一场中东冲突，这种支持已经变得更加难以获得。

        The combination of rhetoric, diplomacy, and terrorism that Iran has
        deftly employed since October 7 advances some of its most long-standing
        ideological and strategic priorities. Like Hamas, Iran’s leadership
        clamors for Israel’s destruction and for the triumph of the Islamic
        world over what it sees as a West in decline. Its views are not
        opportunistic or transient; anti-Americanism and antipathy toward Israel
        are ingrained in the Islamic Republic’s bedrock. But the monumental
        scale of destruction in Gaza has breathed new life into Tehran’s
        anti-Western and anti-Israeli invective. This rhetoric now holds fresh
        appeal for regional audiences who were otherwise unsympathetic toward a
        Shiite theocracy and gives Iran a convenient opportunity to shame its
        Sunni Arab rivals. Tehran sees regional assertiveness as a chance to
        align itself yet more closely with Russia and China, too. Those
        countries’ interests are, for the most part, served by keeping
        Washington mired in a crisis in the Middle East that damages its
        reputation and bleeds its military capacity. Notably, China, Iran, and
        Russia launched a small joint naval drill, the fourth of its kind in the
        past five years, in the Gulf of Oman in early March.

        自10月7日以来，伊朗巧妙地综合运用了言辞、外交和恐怖主义，推进了其一些最根深蒂固的意识形态和战略目标。与哈马斯一样，伊朗领导人呼吁摧毁以色列，以及伊斯兰世界战胜它所认为的衰落中的西方。这些观点不是机会主义或暂时性的；反美主义和对以色列的敌意已深深植根于伊斯兰共和国的基石之中。但加沙地带的浩劫性破坏规模为德黑兰的反西方和反以色列言论注入了新的活力。这些言论现在对原本对什叶派神权政体漠不关心的地区听众具有了新的吸引力，并使伊朗得以方便地羞辱其逊尼派阿拉伯对手。德黑兰认为，地区强硬姿态是进一步靠近俄罗斯和中国的机会。这两个国家的利益基本上在于让华盛顿陷入中东危机，损害其声誉，消耗其军事实力。值得注意的是，3月初，中国、伊朗和俄罗斯在阿曼湾举行了小型联合海军演习，这是过去五年来的第四次此类演习。

        From Tehran’s perspective, the Israel-Hamas war is only accelerating a
        shift in the power balance away from U.S. hegemony and toward a new
        regional order that benefits the Islamic Republic. Ten days after
        Hamas’s attack on Israel, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the speaker of the
        Iranian parliament, warned that a ground invasion of Gaza could “open
        the gates of hell”—that is, trigger an overwhelming response directed
        not just at Israel but also at American interests and assets in the
        region. Still, for Iran’s pugnacious revolutionaries, regime survival
        trumps every other priority, so their approach from October to March was
        guided by careful targeting. After the Biden administration dispatched
        two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean in
        October, Iran and its allies took pains to avoid a precipitous
        escalation. Hezbollah deftly calibrated its attacks on Israel’s north,
        seemingly to avoid drawing Israel into a hotter fight that could erode
        Hezbollah’s ability to deter an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear
        program.
      </p>
      <p>
        从德黑兰的角度看，以巴冲突只会加速权力平衡从美国霸权向有利于伊斯兰共和国的地区新秩序转移。哈马斯袭击以色列十天后，伊朗议长Mohammad
        Baqer
        Qalibaf警告说，对加沙的地面入侵可能会“打开地狱之门”——也就是说，会引发针对以色列、也针对该地区美国利益和资产的压倒性反击。然而，对于好斗的革命者来说，政权生存高于一切，所以从10月到3月，他们的行动都是有针对性的。在拜登政府于10月份向地中海东部派出两个航母打击群之后，伊朗及其盟友都小心翼翼地避免局势迅速升级。真主党似乎精心调整了对以色列北部的袭击，以免将以色列卷入一场削弱真主党阻止以色列打击伊朗核计划能力的更激烈的战斗。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Biden’s rapid deployment of U.S. military assets to the region, together
        with his diplomatic overtures in Lebanon and other key regional actors,
        helped avert the wider war that Hamas may have hoped to precipitate. A
        series of U.S. strikes on Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Syria, and
        Yemen degraded those groups’ capabilities and signaled to Tehran’s
        partners that they will pay a price for continued aggression against
        Americans. Yet the risk of American miscalculations and overconfidence
        will creep up over time. Iran’s militias have a long record of tenacity
        and adaptability, and the weapons at their disposal are relatively
        plentiful and inexpensive, especially compared with the costs of the
        American strikes to eliminate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        拜登迅速向该地区部署美国军事资产，并对黎巴嫩和其他关键地区行为体展开外交接触，这有助于避免哈马斯可能希望挑起的大规模战争。美国对伊拉克、叙利亚和也门的伊朗支持的民兵组织发动一系列打击，削弱了这些组织的能力，并向德黑兰的伙伴发出信号：继续针对美国人采取侵略行动将付出代价。但随着时间推移，美国误判和过度自信的风险会逐渐增加。伊朗的民兵组织具有顽强和适应力强的悠久历史，而他们手中的武器相对丰富且廉价，尤其是与消除这些武器所需的美国打击成本相比。

    </div>
    <div>

        Over the decades, Iran and its proxies have developed keen instincts for
        calibrating risk. Now, having gauged the waning American interest in the
        Middle East, Iranian leaders see an advantage to be gained by gambling.
        With their attacks, they seek to provoke the United States to make
        mistakes that give Tehran and its allies an advantage—mistakes similar
        to the ones Washington made two decades ago, when it invaded Iraq, or in
        2018, when Trump withdrew from President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear
        deal. A miscalculation by any of the actors involved, including Iran
        itself, could ignite a much wider and more intense conflict across the
        Middle East, causing profound damage to regional stability and the
        global economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        数十年来，伊朗及其代理人磨练出了权衡风险的敏锐直觉。现在，德黑兰的领导人判断美国对中东的兴趣正在消退，认为冒险可以占得先机。通过发动袭击，他们希望诱使美国犯下错误，让伊朗及其盟友得利——就像华盛顿二十年前入侵伊拉克，或2018年特朗普退出巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack
        Obama)与伊朗达成的核协议时所做的那样。任何一方的误判——包括伊朗自己——都可能点燃一场蔓延整个中东、程度远超当前的更广泛、更激烈的冲突，给地区稳定和全球经济造成严重损害。
      </p>
    </div>

        To counter Iran’s ambitions, the Biden administration must work with
        Israel and regional allies to further erode Hamas’s ability to launch
        another shock attack against Israeli civilians while ensuring that
        humanitarian assistance reaches desperate Palestinian civilians and
        outlining a path to a postwar future that ensures peace and stability
        for both Israelis and Palestinians. As of late March 2024, Washington
        was continuing to press for an agreement that would require Hezbollah to
        pull its elite forces back from Lebanon’s border with Israel,
        facilitating the return of thousands of Israeli civilians whose homes
        have come under bombardment by Hezbollah rockets since October 7.
        Achieving such an agreement is critical to prevent a wider conflict, and
        Washington must press hard for it, leveraging the obvious interests of
        all parties involved to forestall escalation. In 2022, the United States
        had success in negotiating a maritime border deal between Israel and
        Lebanon to permit gas exploration, which suggests there are other
        opportunities for pragmatic compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
        为了遏制伊朗的野心，拜登政府必须与以色列和区域盟友合作，进一步削弱哈马斯再次对以色列平民发动袭击的能力，同时确保人道主义援助能够送达急需帮助的巴勒斯坦平民，并勾画出通往战后未来的道路，为以色列人和巴勒斯坦人都带来和平与稳定。截至2024年3月末，华盛顿仍在努力促成一项协议，要求真主党将其精锐部队撤出与以色列接壤的黎巴嫩边境，从而让数千名自10月7日以来家园遭到真主党火箭弹袭击的以色列平民得以回归。达成这样的协议对于防止冲突升级至关重要，美国必须为此施加压力，利用所有相关方的明显利益来避免局势恶化。2022年，美国成功促成了以色列和黎巴嫩之间的海上边界协议，允许进行天然气勘探，这表明还有其他务实妥协的机会。

        The Biden administration has already begun to take a more forceful role
        in addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Tragically, these efforts
        may prove to be too little and too late to forestall famine. A famine in
        Gaza would constitute both a strategic and a moral failure for the
        United States as well as for Israel, and Biden must not repeat the
        errors that have allowed the specter of such a cataclysm to grip the
        region. Any truly successful effort to put a stop to the threat from
        Hamas—which, in turn, would curb Iran’s ability to inflict violence on
        Israel—will require mitigating the devastating fallout for Palestinian
        civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
        拜登政府已经开始采取更积极的措施来应对加沙的人道主义危机。遗憾的是，这些努力可能为时已晚，无法避免饥荒的发生。加沙发生饥荒对美国和以色列而言，既是战略失败，也是道德败坏，拜登必须避免重蹈导致这一灾难景象笼罩地区的覆辙。任何成功阻止哈马斯威胁（反过来也会限制伊朗对以色列施暴）的真正努力，都需要减轻对巴勒斯坦平民的毁灭性影响。

      <p>
        Working with nongovernmental organizations and partner governments, the
        U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development
        must rush assistance to Palestinian civilian authorities independent of
        Hamas and other Iranian-backed militias—including aid to ensure they
        have the resources to undertake a reconstruction effort in Gaza when the
        armed conflict stops. After the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon,
        Iran’s rapid delivery of aid enabled Hezbollah to snatch victory from
        the jaws of defeat and outmaneuver the Lebanese government by providing
        instantaneous compensation and rebuilding programs. The United States
        must not allow Tehran or its proxies a similar opening after the war in
        Gaza ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        美国国务院与美国国际开发署应与非政府组织及合作伙伴政府合作，在不经过哈马斯和其他伊朗支持的民兵组织的情况下，迅速向巴勒斯坦民间当局提供援助——包括在军事冲突结束后帮助他们为加沙地带的重建工作提供资源。2006年以黎战争之后，伊朗迅速提供了援助，真主党因此得以在战败后转败为胜，在一瞬间为民众提供了赔偿和重建项目，从而比黎巴嫩政府抢占了先机。美国不能让德黑兰及其代理人在这场加沙战争结束后再次有机可乘。
      </p>
    </div>

        Compounding the challenge for Washington is the reality that Iran has
        accelerated the development of its nuclear program since Trump’s 2018
        withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. It is vital for American
        officials to cultivate a sense of realism. The grand strategic play to
        align Saudi Arabia and Israel may yet come to pass. Normalizing
        Israeli-Saudi relations is an appealing way to undergird peace and
        stability in the region and to counter Iran’s malign influence in the
        long term, but accomplishing it requires complicated political
        scaffolding that has yet to be fully designed, much less erected.
        Achieving that normalization requires more effective short- and
        medium-term game plans to provide governance and security in Gaza, open
        the way for leadership transitions in both the Palestinian territories
        and in Israel, and contain the pressures that a variety of actors,
        especially Iran, are exerting to expand conflict in the Middle East.
        These must be Washington’s priorities over the next year.
      </p>
      <p>
        对华盛顿来说，情况变得更加复杂，因为自2018年特朗普退出伊核协议以来，伊朗已经加快了核计划的开发。美国官员必须实事求是地看待这一切。将沙特和以色列拉到一起的宏伟战略构想也许终会实现。以正常化沙以关系来巩固该地区的和平与稳定，并从长远来看抵消伊朗的恶意影响，这的确很吸引人。但要实现这一目标，还需要尚未设计出、更不用说搭建起来的复杂的地缘政治框架。在短期内，美国需要更有效的计划来为加沙提供治理和安全，为巴勒斯坦领土和以色列的领导层过渡铺平道路，并遏制（尤其是伊朗）各方扩大中东冲突的压力。这些都应该是华盛顿未来一年的优先事项。

        In a sense, Iran now has the default advantage over the United States
        because it does not actually have to achieve anything material in the
        near term. Chaos itself will constitute a victory. By contrast, the bar
        for U.S. success is high. Like it or not, however, the United States
        remains an indispensable player in the region despite its dubious record
        over the past several decades. Standing by its allies—and safeguarding
        access to oil that remains vital to the world economy—with a delicate
        balance of support and restraint requires commitment. Several U.S.
        presidents hoped to downsize America’s role in the Middle East on the
        cheap—in Biden’s case, to focus on China’s challenge and Russia’s
        growing threat. But Hamas and Iran have drawn the United States back in.

        从某种意义上说，伊朗现在占据着默认的优势，因为它在短期内并不需要实现任何实质性成果。混乱本身就是一种胜利。相比之下，美国要取得成功，门槛很高。不管人们是否愿意承认，美国在过去几十年中尽管记录可疑，但它仍然是该地区不可或缺的角色。小心翼翼地在支持与克制之间取得平衡，支持盟友并保障对世界仍然至关重要的石油的访问，这需要承诺。几位美国总统曾希望以廉价的方式缩小美国在中东的角色——在拜登的情况下，是为了应对中国的挑战和俄罗斯日益增长的威胁。但哈马斯和伊朗把美国拉了回来。
