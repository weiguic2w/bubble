        Few hypotheses in international relations are more influential than
        democratic peace theory—the idea that democracies do not go to war with
        one another. The idea, the political scientist Jack Levy wrote, “comes
        as close as anything we have to an empirical law in international
        relations.” It has motivated U.S. foreign policy for nearly a century.
        In the early 1900s, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson embraced democracy
        promotion as a means to peace. During the Cold War, successive
        administrations spoke of the standoff with the Soviet bloc using grand
        ideological terminology. No distillation was grander than President
        Ronald Reagan’s address before the British Parliament in 1982, in which
        he claimed that the West exercised “consistent restraint and peaceful
        intentions” and then proceeded (seemingly without irony) to call for a
        “campaign for democracy” and a “crusade for freedom” around the world.

        在国际关系理论中，没有比民主和平论更有影响力的假设了——这一理论认为，民主国家之间不会开战。政治学家杰克·利维(Jack
        Levy)写道，这个观点“最接近我们所拥有的国际关系经验定律”。近一个世纪以来，它一直影响着美国的外交政策。20世纪初，美国总统伍德罗·威尔逊(Woodrow
        Wilson)将推动民主作为实现和平的手段。冷战期间，历届美国政府都以宏大的意识形态措辞来描述与苏联集团的对峙。其中最宏大的是罗纳德·里根(Ronald
        Reagan)1982年在英国议会发表的演讲。他宣称西方一直“表现出克制和和平意图”，然后(似乎并无讽刺意味)呼吁开展一场“民主运动”和一场“争取自由的十字军东征”。

        Democratic peace theory became especially influential once the Cold War
        ended, leaving the United States truly ascendant. In his 1994 State of
        the Union address, President Bill Clinton claimed that “the best
        strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to
        support the advance of democracy elsewhere.” His administration then
        surged aid to nascent post-Soviet democracies. Clinton’s successor,
        George W. Bush, was equally vocal about the need to advance liberalism
        in order to promote peace, telling the 2004 Republican National
        Convention, “As freedom advances, heart by heart, and nation by nation,
        America will be more secure and the world more peaceful.” As president,
        Bush even used democratic peace theory as one of the justifications for
        invading Iraq. In a speech on the war in November 2003, he declared,
        “The advance of freedom leads to peace.”
      </p>
      <p>
        冷战结束后，民主和平论变得特别有影响力，当时美国真正成了世界主导力量。1994年国情咨文中，比尔·克林顿总统宣称，“确保我们安全和构建持久和平的最好策略，就是支持别处的民主进展”。他的政府随后大幅增加对苏联解体后新兴民主国家的援助。克林顿的继任者乔治·W·布什同样高调宣扬推动自由以促进和平的必要性，他在2004年共和党全国代表大会上说，“随着自由的进步——一个心灵接一个心灵，一个国家接一个国家，美国将更安全，世界将更和平”。作为总统，布什甚至把民主和平论作为入侵伊拉克的理由之一。2003年11月关于伊拉克战争的一次演讲中，他宣称，“自由的进步带来和平”。

        The idea that democracy breeds peace, however, is at best half true. The
        United States has repeatedly attacked other countries. Europe’s major
        democracies also have a long history of intervening in other regions,
        such as the Sahel. And rather than marking the permanent triumph of
        liberal democracy, the post–Cold War period is now defined by growing
        divisions and conflict. As is now plain, the spread of liberalism does
        not by itself curtail fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，民主增进和平的观点至多只对了一半。美国曾多次袭击其他国家。欧洲主要民主国家也长期干涉其他地区，比如萨赫勒地区。而冷战结束后，世界并未迎来自由民主的永久胜利，反而出现了越来越大的分裂和冲突。如今已经很清楚，自由主义的扩展本身并不能遏制战争。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Yet the proliferation of wars carried out by democracies does not
        disprove democratic peace theory wholesale. Liberal states may not act
        peaceably toward everyone, but they act peaceably toward one another.
        There are no clear-cut cases of one democracy going to war against
        another, nor do any seem forthcoming. In fact, the global divisions
        emerging today confirm democratic peace theory: once again, the line
        runs between liberal states and authoritarian ones, with the United
        States and its mostly democratic allies on one side and autocracies,
        most notably China and Russia, on the other. The world, then, could be
        peaceful if all states became liberal democracies. But until that
        happens, the world will likely remain mired in a dangerous ideological
        standoff.
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，民主国家发动的诸多战争并没有彻底证伪民主和平论。自由国家或许不会对所有国家和平共处，但它们会相互和平共处。一个民主国家与另一个民主国家交战的例子尚未出现，而且短期内似乎也不会出现。事实上，当今世界正在显现的分裂再次印证了民主和平论：界线再次划分在自由国家和威权国家之间，一边是美国及其主要的民主盟友，另一边是独裁政权，尤其是中国和俄罗斯。因此，如果所有国家都成为自由民主国家，世界就可能实现和平。但在那之前，世界恐怕仍将深陷危险的意识形态对抗之中。

        Democratic peace theory has a long history. In 1776, the American
        revolutionary Thomas Paine argued that liberal states do not fight one
        another, writing that “the Republics of Europe are all (and we may say
        always) in peace.” When Paine’s country gained independence and then
        drafted its constitution, the document implicitly referred to the idea
        that democracies should be conflict-averse. It placed the authority to
        declare war in the legislature—the branch with members directly elected
        by the public—in part to prevent the country from entering unpopular
        conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        民主国家间不战争的理论有着悠久历史。1776年,美国革命者托马斯·潘恩(Thomas
        Paine)提出,自由国家不会彼此交战,他写道:“欧洲的共和国(我们可以说,一直都是)处在和平中。”当潘恩的国家赢得独立、起草宪法时,这部宪法含蓄地体现了这样的观念:民主国家应避免冲突。它把宣战权交给立法机构——其成员由公众直接选举——部分原因就是为了防止国家卷入不得人心的冲突。

        Democratic peace theory had early proponents across the Atlantic, as
        well. Its most influential initial champion was the German philosopher
        Immanuel Kant. In 1795, Kant published Perpetual Peace, an essay that
        took the form of a hypothetical peace treaty and that established the
        concept’s theoretical foundations. Representative republics, Kant
        explained, did not fight one another for a mix of institutional,
        ideological, and economic reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        “民主和平论”在大西洋两岸早有先驱者。德国哲学家伊曼努尔·康德是这一理论最有影响力的早期倡导者。1795年，他发表了《永久和平论》一书，形式上假定为一份和平条约，实际上奠定了该理论的理论基础。康德解释说，由于制度、意识形态和经济等多方面的原因，代表制共和国之间不会兵戎相见。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Kant’s writings called for states to adopt a representative republican
        form of government with an elected legislative body and a separation of
        powers among the executive, judiciary, and legislative branches—all
        guaranteed by constitutional law. Kant’s republic was far from a modern
        democracy; only male property holders could vote and become what he
        called “active citizens.” Nonetheless, he argued that elected
        representation would inspire caution and that the separation of powers
        would produce careful deliberation. Although these forces would not
        guarantee peace, he admitted, they would select for rational and popular
        conflicts. If “the consent of the citizens is required to decide whether
        or not war is to be declared,” Kant wrote, “it is very natural that they
        will have great hesitation in embarking on so dangerous an enterprise.”
        For doing so, he continued,
      </p>
      <p>
        康德的著作呼吁各国建立一种代议制共和国，拥有选举产生的立法机构和行政、司法、立法三权分立——所有这些都由宪法保障。在康德的共和国中，只有男性财产所有者才能投票，并成为他所谓的“积极公民”。尽管如此，他还是认为，选举产生的代表将带来谨慎，而分权将产生深思熟虑。他承认，这些力量并不能确保和平，但它们会选择理性和大众化的冲突。康德写道，如果“要宣战或不宣战，需要公民的同意”，那么“他们会很自然地对如此危险的事业犹豫不决”。他接着说，
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        would mean calling down on themselves all the miseries of war, such as
        doing the fighting themselves, supplying the costs of the war from their
        own resources, painfully making good the ensuing devastation, and, as
        the crowning evil, having to take upon themselves a burden of debt which
        will embitter peace itself and which can never be paid off on account of
        the constant threat of new wars. But under a constitution in which the
        subject is not a citizen, and which is therefore not republican, it is
        the simplest thing in the world to go to war. For the head of state is
        not a fellow citizen, but the owner of the state, and a war will not
        force him to make the slightest sacrifice so far as his banquets, hunts,
        pleasure palaces and court festivals are concerned. He can thus decide
        on war, without any significant reason, as a kind of amusement, and
        unconcernedly leave it to the diplomatic corps (who are always ready for
        such purposes) to justify the war for the sake of propriety.
      </p>

        这就要他们自食其战祸，从自己的腰包里掏出钱来支付战争费用，自己去忍受战后种种困苦，并且背上一笔大债，这笔债会使得和平本身也变得味同嚼蜡，而且由于不断有新战争的威胁而永远无法偿还。但是在非共和政体之下，公民是不参加政权的，因此，打仗是最轻而易举的事。因为国家首脑并不是一个公民，而是国家的所有者；战争不会使他在宴会、狩猎、游乐宫和宫廷节庆方面有一点点牺牲。他可以毫无充足的理由，仅仅为了消遣，就决定发动战争，而把替战争辩解这种例行公事，满不在乎地交给外交使团去办理（他们是随时准备这样做的）。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Kant also called for republics to make commitments to peace and
        universal hospitality. The former idea entailed a commitment to peaceful
        relations and collective self-defense, rather like NATO’s. The latter
        meant treating all international visitors without hostility, offering
        asylum to people whose lives were at risk, and allowing visitors to
        share their ideas and propose commercial exchanges. This combination,
        Kant said, would build security, create mutual respect, and generate
        economic ties that lead to tranquility. And thus, republic by emerging
        republic, the combination would create peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        康德还呼吁共和国承诺维护和平与普遍的待客之道。前者意味着承诺和平关系和集体自卫，有点像北约那样。后者意味着不敌视任何国际访客，为生命受到威胁的人提供庇护，允许访客分享想法并提出商业交换建议。康德说，这种结合将建立安全，培养相互尊重，并建立起带来安宁的经济联系。因此，一个接一个的共和国将会带来和平。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Kant did not argue that his ideas would stop tension and conflict
        between republics and autocracies. In fact, he argued that
        representative republics might become suspicious of states not ruled by
        their citizens. But he did believe that liberal values such as human
        rights and respect for property would curb a country’s desire for glory,
        fear of conquest, and need to plunder—three forces that drive states to
        war. He therefore thought that liberal republics would be respectful and
        restrained when addressing one another, even as they remained suspicious
        and fearful of nonrepublics.
      </p>
      <p>
        康德可没有说他的理念能消除共和国与专制国家之间的紧张和冲突事实上，他还认为，代议制共和国或许会对非公民治理的国家抱有疑虑。但他确实相信，诸如人权和财产权这样的自由价值观会抑制一个国家对荣耀的追求、对被征服的恐惧以及劫掠的需求——这些都会驱使国家走向战争。因此，他认为自由共和国在彼此打交道时会表现得尊重而克制，即便它们对非共和国仍然抱有疑虑和畏惧。

        Views similar to Kant’s on liberty, republics, commerce, and peace
        spread throughout nineteenth-century Europe and beyond. French Foreign
        Minister Francois Guizot, a conservative liberal who served from 1840 to
        1848, spoke enthusiastically about mutual freedom as a foundation for an
        entente with the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister William
        Gladstone, who led his country for much of the latter half of the 1800s,
        was a proponent. And when U.S. President Abraham Lincoln issued the
        Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it helped tilt liberal opinion in
        Europe toward the Union and away from the Confederacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        十九世纪，类似康德的自由、共和国、商业和和平的观点传遍了欧洲甚至更远的地方。曾任法国外交部长（1840-1848年）的保守派自由主义者弗朗索瓦·基佐(Francois
        Guizot)曾热情地谈到，英法和解应建立在相互自由的基础上。英国首相威廉·格莱斯顿(William
        Gladstone)——他在19世纪下半叶大部分时间里领导着英国——也是这一观点的支持者。1863年，当美国总统亚伯拉罕·林肯(Abraham
        Lincoln)发表《解放奴隶宣言》(Emancipation
        Proclamation)时，它帮助改变了欧洲自由主义舆论对美国内战的立场，使其转向支持联邦，而非邦联。

        It was not, however, until World War I that the full democratic peace
        proposition became central to foreign policy. Wilson’s war message in
        April 1917—in which he declared that the battle between autocracies and
        democracies would establish “the principles of peace and justice”—was
        the clarion call. The clash between democracy and autocracy continued to
        shape policy as the decades went on. The behavior of the United States
        during the Cold War, for example, was often motivated by a belief that
        spreading liberal values would yield peace. As Secretary of State John
        Foster Dulles declared in his 1953 Senate confirmation hearing, “We
        shall never have a secure peace or a happy world so long as Soviet
        communism dominates one-third of all the peoples that there are.”
        President John F. Kennedy echoed that theme in his 1963 speech in West
        Berlin, declaring that “when all are free, then we can look forward to
        that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this
        great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，直到第一次世界大战，民主国家间不会开战的观念才成为外交政策的核心。1917年4月，伍德罗·威尔逊总统在向国会发表的战争咨文中宣称，专制政体与民主政体之间的较量将确立“和平与正义的原则”，这可视为这一观念的号角。在随后的几十年里，民主与威权的对抗继续塑造着政策。例如，在冷战期间，美国的很多行为都出于对传播自由价值观能够带来和平的信念。1953年，约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯在参议院确认其国务卿提名的听证会上宣称：“只要苏联共产主义统治世界上三分之一的人口，我们就永远不会有一个安全的和平或一个幸福的世界。”1963年，约翰·F·肯尼迪在西柏林的演讲中重申了这一观点，他宣称：“当所有人都获得自由时，我们就可以期待这一天，那时这个城市将合而为一，这个国家和整个欧洲大陆将共同生活在一个充满和平与希望的地球上。”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        But that same month, in a powerful address at American University,
        Kennedy warned of the complementary dangers of ideological confrontation
        with the Soviet Union. “Let us not be blind to our differences—but let
        us also direct attention to our common interests and the means by which
        those differences can be resolved,” he said. “If we cannot end now our
        differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity.”
      </p>
      <p>
        但在那同一个月，肯尼迪在美国大学发表了一篇强有力的演讲，警告与苏联进行意识形态对抗的相应危险。“我们不能对双方的分歧视而不见——但我们也必须关注共同利益，以及解决这些分歧的途径，”他说。“如果我们现在无法消除分歧，至少我们可以帮助世界变得容忍差异。”

        As liberalism endured and spread, intellectuals began empirically
        testing whether democratic peace theory actually held true. In 1939, the
        American journalist Clarence Streit published a qualitative historical
        analysis to see whether liberal democracies tended to maintain peace
        among themselves. Discerning that the answer was yes, he proposed that
        the decade’s leading democracies form a federal union, which would help
        protect them from fascist powers. In 1972, Dean Babst, building on
        Quincy Wright’s magisterial A Study of War from 30 years earlier,
        carried out a statistical analysis that also suggested a correlation
        between democracy and peace. In 1976, Melvin Small and J. David Singer
        confirmed this finding but demonstrated that democratic peace was
        limited to relations between democracies. Republics, they showed, were
        still prone to fight autocratic regimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        随着自由主义的持续和传播，知识分子开始从经验上检验民主和平理论是否真的成立。1939年，美国记者克拉伦斯·斯特雷特(Clarence
        Streit)发表了一篇定性的历史分析，探讨自由民主国家之间是否倾向于维持和平。他意识到答案是肯定的，于是提议本世纪主要的民主国家组成一个联邦联盟，这将有助于保护它们免受法西斯势力的侵害。1972年，迪恩·巴布斯特(Dean
        Babst)在昆西·赖特(Quincy Wright) 30年前的权威著作《战争研究》(A Study of
        War)的基础上，进行了一项统计分析，也表明民主与和平之间存在相关性。1976年，梅尔文·斯莫尔和j·大卫·辛格证实了这一发现，但表明民主和平仅限于民主国家之间的关系。他们表明，共和国仍然倾向于对抗专制政权。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        In the decades since, international relations scholars have continued to
        study the democratic peace paradigm. They have shown that the
        relationship between democracy and peace is statistically significant
        even when controlling for proximity, wealth, and trade. They have
        determined that the theory holds even when states attempt to constrain
        each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        此后的几十年中，国际关系学者继续对民主和平论题进行研究。他们发现，即使在控制了邻近性、财富和贸易等因素之后，民主与和平之间的关联在统计上仍然具有显著性。他们断定，即使国家试图互相遏制，这一理论依然成立。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Academics have advanced a wide variety of explanations for why the
        concept is so sturdy. Some have argued that part of the reason lies in
        the disproportionate influence that international institutions have with
        liberal countries. Research shows that democracies tend to delegate a
        lot of policymaking to complex multilateral bodies, such as the European
        Union and the World Trade Organization, in part because their leaders
        can use these groups to entrench policies before cycling out of office.
        Other scholars have argued that liberal norms favoring peace, human
        rights, and respect for fellow democracies hold sway over policymakers
        and publics. And still others have pointed to the benefits of trade and
        economic interdependence associated with relations among capitalist
        democracies. States that frequently trade, after all, will lose wealth
        if they fight one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        学界提出过很多理论，试图解释为何这个观念如此根深蒂固。有人认为，其中一个原因是国际机制在自由国家中拥有不成比例的影响力。研究显示，民主国家往往倾向于将大量政策制定权交给复杂的多边机构，比如欧盟和世界贸易组织，部分原因在于，这些国家的领导人可以利用这些机构，在自己离职前将政策永久化。还有人认为，和平、人权和尊重其他国家民主政体这样的自由准则，对决策者和公众具有约束力。另外一些人则指出，资本主义民主国家之间的贸易和经济相互依赖带来的益处。毕竟，经常进行贸易往来的国家如果兵戎相见，将会蒙受财富损失。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Still, democratic peace theory has attracted plenty of critics. Henry
        Farber and Joanne Gowa have pointed out that there are other forces at
        work in stopping wars between democracies. During the Cold War, for
        example, NATO’s need to protect itself from the Soviet bloc ensured that
        Western Europe cooperated—although the region’s post–Cold War peace
        suggests more than collaborative containment is at work. Other scholars
        have pointed out that none of the factors used to explain democratic
        peace theory can stop war on its own. States that are deeply involved in
        international institutions, after all, do launch invasions. Peaceful
        norms and ideas work only if democracies heed them in the policymaking
        process, yet they are often ignored. The shared decision-making powers
        of republics should encourage deliberation, but the division of powers
        and rotation of elites can also lead democracies to send mixed signals,
        putting other states on edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        但民主和平论也招致了很多批评。亨利·法伯(Henry
        Farber)和乔安妮·戈瓦(Joanne
        Gowa)指出，还有其他因素在阻止民主国家间发生战争。例如，在冷战期间，北大西洋公约组织(NATO)保护自身免受苏联集团威胁的需要，确保了西欧的合作——尽管冷战后欧洲的和平表明，合作遏制以外的因素也在起作用。其他学者则指出，用来解释民主和平论的所有因素都无法单独防止战争。毕竟，深陷国际制度的国家也会发动侵略。和平规范和理念只有在民主国家将它们纳入政策制定过程时才会起作用，而这种情况经常发生。共和国的共同决策权本应促进审议，但权力的分割和精英的更迭也可能导致民主国家发出混合信号，让其他国家感到紧张。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        And economic benefits can be achieved through plunder, not just through
        trade. Powerful democratic states can have rational incentives to
        exploit wealthy, weak democracies, especially if the latter are endowed
        with natural resources or strategic assets such as shipping lanes.
        Rational material interest is not enough to explain why xenophobic
        democracies have not tried to conquer democracies of other ethnic
        groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        而财富不仅可以经由交易获得，也可以通过劫掠获得。
        强大的民主国家可能有理性的动机去剥削那些富足而弱小的民主国家，尤其是当这些国家拥有自然资源或战略资产（如航道）的时候。理性物质利益无法解释为什么仇外的民主国家没有试图征服其他民族的民主国家。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        But put all the explanatory factors together, and democratic peace
        theory coheres. When governments are constrained by international
        institutions, when political elites or the electorate are committed to
        norms of liberty, when the public’s views are reflected through
        representative institutions, and when democracies trade and invest in
        one another, conflicts among republics are peacefully resolved.
      </p>

        但把这些解释因素合在一起，民主和平论就讲得通了：当政府受制于国际制度，政治精英或选民致力于自由准则，公众的意见通过代议制机构得到体现，以及民主国家相互之间进行贸易和投资时，共和国之间的冲突就能和平解决。

        U.S. President Donald Trump subjected democratic peace theory to an
        intense test. He picked fights with European allies while praising
        Russian President Vladimir Putin and other dictators. Trump also cajoled
        and threatened liberal allies in other parts of the world, including
        East Asia. For a time, the United States seemed just as hostile toward
        fellow democracies as it was toward autocracies.

        唐纳德·特朗普(Donald
        Trump)总统对民主和平理论进行了严格测试。他与欧洲盟友闹翻，同时对俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir
        Putin)和其他独裁者大加赞扬。他还对包括东亚在内的世界其他地区的自由派盟友软硬兼施。有一段时间，美国对民主国家表现出的敌意，看上去并不亚于它对威权政体的敌意。

        But under President Joe Biden, democratic peace is back in vogue. Like
        many of his predecessors, Biden has made promoting freedom a hallmark of
        his foreign policy. He has routinely described global politics as a
        contest between democracies and autocracies, featuring the United States
        and its allies in one corner and China and Russia in the other. Speaking
        at the UN in 2021, Biden pledged not to enter a “new cold war,” but he
        also announced that the world is at “an inflection point” and drew a
        sharp line between authoritarian and democratic regimes. “The future
        will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it,” Biden
        said.
      </p>
      <p>
        但在乔·拜登总统任下，民主和平论再度流行起来。与许多前任一样，拜登将促进自由作为其外交政策的基石。他经常将全球政治描述为民主国家与威权政体之间的竞争，美国及其盟友身处一方，中国和俄罗斯则在另一方。2021年在联合国讲话时，拜登承诺不会开启“新冷战”，但他也宣称世界正处在一个“转折点”，并在威权主义和民主政权之间划清了界限。“未来属于那些拥抱人类尊严而非践踏它的人，”拜登说。

        The president clearly aims to mobilize democracies, especially liberal
        industrial democracies, against dictatorships. His broad ideological
        framing emphasizes the threats posed by Russia to Europe’s democracies
        and by China to East Asia’s, including Taiwan. He has invoked ideology
        when promoting the importance of NATO in Europe and the Quad (the U.S.
        partnership with Australia, India, and Japan) in Asia and invested new
        resources in both bodies. Whether Biden wants it or not, the world may
        succumb to a new cold war. Much like the last one, it will be
        categorized by a clash between different systems of government.
      </p>
      <p>
        总统显然打算动员民主国家，尤其是自由工业民主国家，来对付专制政权。他的宽泛意识形态框架强调了俄罗斯对欧洲民主国家以及中国对东亚民主国家（包括台湾）构成的威胁。他在强调北约在欧洲、四国机制(美国与澳大利亚、印度和日本的伙伴关系)在亚洲的重要性时，都援引了意识形态，并向这两个组织投入了新资源。不管拜登愿不愿意，世界可能都要陷入一场新的冷战。像上一次一样，这将是一场不同政体之间的冲突。

        States are already taking sides, lining up according to regime type.
        Democratic Finland and Sweden, neutral during the first Cold War, have
        joined NATO. Ireland has moved closer to the alliance. China and Russia
        have recruited Iran and North Korea to their team, fellow autocracies
        that are providing arms for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has, in
        turn, used its UN Security Council seat to make it harder for the world
        to monitor North Korea’s nuclear program. China is buying up Iranian
        oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        各国已经根据政权类型站队了。在第一次冷战期间保持中立的民主国家芬兰和瑞典加入了北约。爱尔兰已经向联盟靠拢。中国和俄罗斯已经招募伊朗和朝鲜加入他们的队伍，这两个专制国家正在为俄罗斯入侵乌克兰提供武器。反过来，俄罗斯利用其在联合国安理会的席位，使世界更难以监督朝鲜的核计划。中国正在购买伊朗的石油。

        This cold war—should the world indeed succumb to it—will be different
        from the first one. It pits democracies against autocracies, not
        capitalists against communists. Its geopolitics put a rising power
        (China) against an old hegemon (the United States), and an aggressive
        militarist (Putin) against an overstretched alliance (NATO). Every party
        sees itself on the defensive. The United States and its allies want a
        “world safe for democracy” in which national security is affordable,
        elections are secure, markets are free, and human rights remain an
        ideal. China, Russia, and their allies want a world safe for autocracy,
        where governments are free to skip elections and neglect human rights,
        where markets and information are subject to state direction, and where
        no one outside the government questions state policy. Both sides are
        threatened because those two visions are incompatible.
      </p>
      <p>
        如果这场新冷战最终来临，它将与上一场大不相同。如今的对抗是民主国家与威权政体之间的较量，而不是资本主义与共产主义的对决。地缘政治冲突是一轮崛起的大国（中国）与一个老去的霸权（美国）之间的较量，是一个好战的军国主义者（普京）与一个捉襟见肘的联盟（北约）之间的较量。每一方都自认为是在防守。美国及其盟友希望建立一个“民主安全的世界”，在其中国家安全成本可负担，选举安全，市场自由，且人权仍是理想。而中国、俄罗斯及其盟友则希望生活在一个对威权政体安全的世界中，政府可以不举行选举，忽视人权，市场和信息受到国家指导，而政府之外无人质询国家政策。由于这两种愿景无法共存，双方都感受到了威胁。

        The divisions, of course, are not always so neat. As happened during the
        first Cold War, a number of developing countries, including some
        democracies, are seeking nonalignment. And as it did during the
        U.S.-Soviet standoff, Washington has autocratic partners, such as the
        Arab Gulf countries. But even within these relationships, ideology
        appears to be having an effect. The largest of the states in the neutral
        bloc, India, is partnering more closely with the United States as the
        two countries compete with Beijing, and both have repeatedly praised the
        other for being a democracy (even if India’s democracy is showing signs
        of distress). The United States and its liberal allies, meanwhile, are
        making authoritarian partners uneasy. Biden, for example, referred to
        Saudi Arabia as a “pariah” during his campaign, even though the United
        States has relied on Saudi oil production to help keep oil prices down.
      </p>
      <p>
        当然，阵营的划分并不总是那么清晰。如同在第一次冷战期间，包括一些民主国家在内的许多发展中国家都在寻求不结盟。和当年美苏对峙时一样，华盛顿也有一些专制盟友，比如阿拉伯海湾国家。但即便在这些关系中，意识形态似乎也发挥了作用。在不结盟集团中最大的国家印度，在与美国一道与中国竞争之际，正与其走得更近，两国都一再称赞对方是民主国家（尽管印度的民主制度已出现衰败迹象）。与此同时，美国及其自由主义盟友也让专制政权感到不安。例如，拜登在竞选期间曾称沙特为“贱民”，尽管美国一直依靠沙特的石油生产来压低油价。

        The world’s great powers can still prevent these democratic-autocratic
        tensions from hardening into a full-blown cold war. Through effective
        diplomacy, they might be able to construct a kind of cold peace, or a
        détente in which countries shun subversive transformation in favor of
        mutual survival and global prosperity. Pursuing such a world may,
        indeed, be an obligation for democracies. As Kant insisted and Kennedy
        pleaded, in a responsible representative government, leaders must strive
        to protect free republics but also avoid unnecessary conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        但全球大国仍可防止这些民主与威权之间的紧张关系升级为全面冷战通过有效的外交手段它们或许能够构建一种不那么冰冷的和平或者类似缓和的状态各国不鼓动颠覆性变革转而追求相互存续与全球繁荣追求这样的世界事实上可能是对所有民主国家的一项责任正如康德所强调的以及肯尼迪所恳求的在一个负责任的代议制政府中领导人必须努力保护自由共和国但也避免不必要的冲突

        Yet a true cold peace would require settling the war over Ukraine,
        creating a new understanding with Beijing and Taipei about the status of
        Taiwan, and striking arms control agreements—tasks that are nearly
        impossible. Instead, the world’s democratic powers appear to be girding
        themselves for a long twilight struggle with authoritarian regimes. This
        struggle may be scary, but it should not come as a surprise. It is, in
        fact, exactly what democratic peace theory predicts. Liberal states are
        being cooperative and peaceable toward fellow members of the club,
        working through institutions such as NATO and the Quad. But with respect
        to autocracies, they remain ready for war.
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，真正的冷和平则需要解决乌克兰战争，就台湾地位与北京和台北达成新谅解，以及达成军控协议——这些任务几乎是不可能完成的。相反，世界上的民主国家似乎正在为与威权政权进行一场长期的黄昏之战做准备。这场斗争可能是可怕的，但不应该令人感到意外。事实上，这正是民主和平理论所预测的。自由国家对俱乐部里的伙伴表现出合作和和平，通过北约(NATO)和四国集团(Quad)等机制开展工作。但在对待威权政体时，它们仍然保持战争准备。
