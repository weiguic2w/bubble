        Until recently, it may have seemed as if religion were on the way out.
        As people grew richer and more educated, the thinking went, they would
        begin to rely less on the solace and meaning provided by faith. That is
        what happened in much of western Europe, where church membership rates
        have cratered over the last century. According to a 2018 Pew study, only
        11 percent of people in western European countries say religion is a
        very important part of their lives. Proponents of so-called
        modernization theory see religion as a defense mechanism, a hedge
        against chaos and depredation; religions would invariably lose adherents
        in a safer, more ordered and comfortable world. As recently as 2020, the
        political scientist Ronald Inglehart claimed in these pages that
        religion was in global decline. “As societies develop, survival becomes
        more secure,” he noted, adding, “And as this level of security rises,
        people tend to become less religious.”
      </p>
      <p>
        直到最近，宗教似乎正在走向衰落。随着人们变得更加富裕和受过更好的教育，他们对信仰所提供的慰藉和意义的依赖就会减少——至少按照这一逻辑推理是这样的。这在西欧大部分地区的确发生了，过去一个世纪里，那里的教会成员比例大幅下降。根据皮尤研究中心2018年的一项研究，西欧国家只有11%的人表示宗教在他们的生活中非常重要。所谓现代化理论的支持者认为，宗教是一种防御机制，是对混乱和掠夺的防范；在一个更安全、更有秩序、更舒适的世界里，宗教不可避免地会失去信徒。就在2020年，政治学家罗纳德·英格尔哈特(Ronald
        Inglehart)还在本刊撰文称，宗教在全球范围内正在衰落。“随着社会的发展，生存变得更有保障，”他写道，“而随着这种安全感的提高，人们的宗教信仰也趋于减弱。”

        But a wider look at trends in religiosity reveals a more complex
        reality. The story of religion over the past century is not one of
        contraction but of continued growth and consolidation. That, at least,
        is the contention of the British economist Paul Seabright’s new book,
        The Divine Economy, in which he insists that “the world is coming to be
        dominated by a handful of religions to an extent that has never been
        seen before.” Chief among these expanding faiths are Islam and
        Christianity, now boasting around 2.0 billion and 2.6 billion adherents,
        respectively. Both are making impressive gains, finding new audiences
        and devotees in the world’s fastest-growing populations, notably in
        Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
        但更广泛的宗教趋势显示，现实要复杂得多。过去一个世纪的宗教故事并非衰落，而是持续增长和巩固。至少，英国经济学家保罗·西布赖特(Paul
        Seabright)在其新书《神的经济》(The Divine
        Economy)中是这样认为的，他坚持认为，“世界正以前所未有的程度被少数几种宗教所主导”。在这些不断壮大的信仰中，伊斯兰教和基督教最为突出，分别拥有约20亿和26亿信徒。这两种宗教都在迅速增长，在全球人口增长最快的地区——尤其是非洲——找到了新的受众和信徒。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        And contrary to what modernization theory and its variants predict,
        prosperity and economic growth are hardly killing off religion. In
        China, Seabright claims, there are now probably “at least as many active
        Christians and Muslims as members of the Chinese Communist Party.” In
        India, the fastest-growing economy in the G-20, religion plays an
        increasingly important role in public life. In the United States, church
        membership fell below 50 percent in 2020 after hovering at around 70
        percent for the better part of the twentieth century. But according to a
        2023 Pew poll, 88 percent of Americans still believe in the God of the
        Bible or some other higher power or spiritual force.
      </p>
      <p>
        与现代化理论及其变体所预测的相反，繁荣和经济增长几乎没有消灭宗教。在中国，Seabright声称，现在“活跃的基督徒和穆斯林至少和中共党员一样多。”在20国集团中增长最快的经济体印度，宗教在公共生活中扮演着越来越重要的角色。在美国，教会成员在20世纪的大部分时间里徘徊在70%左右，到2020年降至50%以下。但根据2023年皮尤民意调查，88%的美国人仍然相信圣经中的上帝或其他更高的力量或精神力量。

      <p>
        Those who imagined religion fading away before the advance of science
        and commercial prosperity misunderstood its full dimensions. It is not
        enough to see religion as a matter of personal, private belief; it is
        also a communal practice, reflected in public ritual, shared experience,
        and the formation of identity. Religion isn’t just, or even primarily,
        about believing in a particular way. Many Catholics attend Mass and take
        Communion even if they have doubts that they are receiving the body and
        blood of Christ. At least according to some surveys, a surprisingly
        large number of evangelicals appear unsure about the divinity of Christ,
        which of course is a creedal requirement for being Christian. But as
        Seabright notes, the original Greek word for creed, symbolon, referred
        to “a mechanism for verifying someone’s identity by matching two halves
        of a broken object.” It was about deferring to the right authorities and
        signaling which group one belonged to, rather than “what piece of
        theology might be passing simultaneously through their mind as they were
        speaking.”
      </p>
      <p>
        以为科学和商业繁荣会把宗教消解掉的人，没有认识到宗教的全部含义。将宗教视为一种个人、私人的信仰还不够；它也是一种集体行为，在公共仪式、共同体验以及身份认同的形成中都有所体现。宗教不仅仅是一种特定的信仰方式，甚至主要不是这样。很多天主教徒即使怀疑自己在圣餐中并没有领受到基督的身体和血液，也会去做弥撒和领圣餐。根据一些调查，居然有相当数量的福音派信徒对基督的神性表示不确定，而这当然属于基督教的基本信条。但正如塞布赖特指出的，最初的希腊语“信经”(symbolon)一词指的是“通过比对两个半片来核实某人的身份”，其意义在于对正确权威表示顺从，表明自己属于哪个群体，而不是“说话时脑子里同时在想什么神学问题”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        To view religion as primarily social—as something that comes alive when
        it is done in the company of others or that springs from the knowledge
        that one is doing the same thing that others are doing—allows a shift
        away from a preoccupation with the interiority of individual belief. The
        Divine Economy is an ambitious work that attempts to think economically
        about something that so often seems beyond the grasp of the social
        sciences. Seabright argues that the most successful and enduring
        religious messages can be explained by cost and benefit, supply and
        demand, and rational self-interest. That approach to religion may feel
        crude to believers who see their personal faith as ineffable and not
        reducible to such grubby material terms. But Seabright’s way of
        conceiving of religion helps explain why it remains so powerful in a
        supposedly secular world.
      </p>
      <p>
        把宗教视为一种社会现象——在群体中进行时才会活跃，或源于知道自己与他人所做相同的行为——可以转移对个人信仰内在性的过分关注。《神的经济》是一部雄心勃勃的作品，尝试从经济学角度解读那些常常被认为超出社会科学理解范围的事物。西布利认为，最成功和持久的宗教信息可以用成本和收益、供求和理性自利来解释。那种对宗教的理解方式，对于视个人信仰为无法言喻、并非可以用世俗的功利性术语来简化的人来说，可能会觉得粗俗。但西布利对宗教的构想有助于解释，在这个看似世俗化的世界里，宗教为何依然如此强大。

        It takes a leap of faith for people to believe in the unseen in a world
        that tells them that everything must be “rational.” To be Christian, one
        must presumably believe in Christ. To be Muslim, one must—again,
        presumably—believe in the divinity of the Koran and the prophethood of
        Muhammad.
      </p>
      <p>
        在一个凡事讲究理性的世界中，要人们相信无形的事物需要很大的信心。想成为基督徒，照理说你得相信耶稣。想成为穆斯林，照理说你得相信《可兰经》的神圣性和穆罕默德的先知身份。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Historically, however, it has always been a bit more complicated. Since
        it was (and still is) impossible to know what people truly believe,
        religious leaders have been more than happy to accept outward
        professions of faith as sincere. After all, the more congregants, the
        better. Often, people had financial incentives to convert. Other
        incentives exist, as well. Under Islamic law, a Muslim woman can legally
        marry any man who is willing to publicly profess the Islamic creed. This
        is all it takes to become Muslim, and for love, one might be willing to
        say something one does not, in fact, believe to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        然而从历史上看，情况总是比较复杂些。由于无法真正了解人们相信什么，宗教领袖很乐意接受外在的信仰表白为真诚的表示。毕竟，信徒越多越好。许多情况下，人们改信宗教有经济上的动机。也存在其他动机。根据伊斯兰教法，穆斯林女性可以和任何愿意公开宣誓信仰伊斯兰教的男人结婚。这就是成为穆斯林所需要的全部，为了爱情，一个人可能愿意说一些他实际上并不相信的话。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Then there are cases of people who would like to believe but, for
        whatever reason, cannot. In such cases, ritual and participation can do
        a lot of the heavy lifting. Belonging may come before belief rather than
        vice versa. In a state of inner torment, the Christian philosopher John
        Ruskin wished for heavenly reward but was no longer certain that heaven
        existed. He wrote to his father in 1852 that he “would act as if the
        Bible were true.” More recently, Honor Levy, an American podcaster,
        writer, and convert to Catholicism, explained, “You just do the rituals,
        and then it becomes real, even if you don’t [initially] believe in it.
        That’s what religion is.” Through sheer force of will, one can resolve
        that God is real.
      </p>
      <p>
        然后有些想信却(由于某些原因)无法真正相信的人。在这种情况下，仪式和参与就能发挥很大的作用。认同可能先于信念，而不是相反。基督教哲学家约翰·罗斯金在内心极度痛苦时，渴望得到天堂的奖赏，但已不再确定天堂是否存在。他在1852年写给父亲的信中说，他会“假设《圣经》是真实的”。最近，美国播客、作家和天主教皈依者霍诺·利维(Honor
        Levy)解释说：“你只要去做那些仪式，它就会变得真实——即使你起初并不相信。这就是宗教。”通过纯粹的意志力，一个人可以决定上帝是存在的。

        These might sound like spiritual acrobatics, but they are variations of
        the long-standing (and often misunderstood) argument known as Pascal’s
        Wager. The seventeenth-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal
        posited that it was in one’s self-interest to find a way to believe in
        God even if God might not actually exist. The potential benefit of such
        belief was eternal salvation, and even a small chance at something as
        consequential as eternity trumps any of the relatively minor
        inconveniences associated with belief. What is less well known,
        Seabright reminds readers, is that Pascal confessed in the same tract
        that this sort of internally compelled belief will “make you more
        stupid.” But Pascal’s broader insight is one that could easily be
        applied to most, if not all, areas of life: it can be rational to be
        irrational.
      </p>
      <p>
        这听起来可能像是精神上的杂耍，但其实都是对那个古老的(而且常常被误解的)论点的变种，该论点被称为帕斯卡赌注(Pascal’s
        Wager)。17世纪的法国数学家布莱士·帕斯卡(Blaise
        Pascal)认为，即便上帝也许并不存在，人们也有自我利益上的理由去找到相信上帝的方法。这种信仰的潜在好处是永生，而哪怕只有很小的机会获得如此重大的结果，也胜过与信仰相关的任何相对较小的不便。塞布赖特提醒读者，帕斯卡在同一篇论著中也承认，这种出于内在压力的信仰“会使你变得更愚蠢”。但帕斯卡更广泛的洞见是，这个道理可以很容易地应用于生活的大多数、如果不是全部领域：理性地对待非理性可能是合理的。

        The mundane underpins the spiritual in the making of religious
        organizations. In The Divine Economy, Seabright analyzes religions as if
        they were corporations. Many faiths have fallen by the wayside over the
        millennia, unable to compete in the marketplace of piety. In looking at
        religion this way, Seabright joins an old tradition, going back at least
        as far as Adam Smith, of economists’ trying to understand devotion in
        material terms. “The velvet glove of enchantment,” Seabright writes,
        “clothes the iron fist of organization.” Borrowing from Smith, he
        explores how market incentives shape the character and content of
        religious messages. New religious movements, if they wish to gain
        adherents, must be dynamic, flexible, and tolerant of diversity. Writing
        in the eighteenth century, Smith compared energetic and often
        sensationalist Methodist preachers with the more reserved and cerebral
        parsons of the Church of England. The former needed to attract new
        audiences to earn their keep and so preached more vigorously. The latter
        enjoyed reliable salaries, political patronage, and institutional
        privileges and so did not feel compelled to change their behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        在宗教组织的运作中，日常世俗活动支撑着精神层面的活动。在《神圣经济》一书中，希布瑞特将宗教组织分析得像企业一样。千百年来，许多信仰在虔诚的市场中竞争失败了。希布瑞特以这种方式看待宗教，加入了一个至少可以追溯到亚当·斯密的古老传统，经济学家试图用物质条件来解释虔诚。“魅力的天鹅绒手套”，希布瑞特写道，“包裹着组织的铁拳”。借鉴斯密，他探讨了市场激励如何塑造宗教信息的性质和内容。如果新宗教运动希望获得信徒，它们就必须充满活力、灵活并且容忍多样性。18世纪的斯密曾把精力旺盛、经常耸人听闻的卫理公会传教士与更为矜持、思想深沉的英国国教会牧师进行比较。前者需要吸引新的听众来维持生计，因此布道更为卖力。后者则享受着稳定的薪水、政治庇护和制度特权，所以没有改变行为的动力。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        These privileges were analogous to the subsidies that governments
        provide to some private-sector companies, which then have less incentive
        to innovate and take risks. Like firms, religions must compete for
        consumers. Sometimes, this means that they must accentuate what makes
        them different; other times, it means softening off-putting theological
        claims in order to reach a wider audience. But sometimes brute material
        forces determine success or failure. As Seabright puts it, “Without
        economic resources behind them, the most beautifully crafted messages
        will struggle to gain a hearing in the cacophony of life.” It is rare
        and even refreshing to have a book about the rise of religion that
        concludes, in a sense, that it’s the economy, stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
        这与政府给予某些私营企业的补贴类似，这些补贴降低了企业创新和承担风险的积极性。如同企业必须争取消费者一样，宗教也必须争取信众。有时候，这意味着它们必须强调自身与众不同的地方；有时则意味着它们要缓和可能让人望而却步的神学主张，以争取更广泛的受众。但有时候，赤裸裸的物质力量决定了成败。用塞布赖特的话说就是，“如果没有经济资源作后盾，最精心打造的信息也会在生活的嘈杂声中难以获得关注。”一本关于宗教兴起的书得出这样的结论实属难得，可以说是令人耳目一新：归根结底，是经济，笨蛋。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        But that doesn’t make such an explanation entirely convincing. At their
        advent, Christianity and Islam—effectively the Walmarts and Apples of
        today’s religious marketplace—had comparatively few such resources.
        Before they were powerful, they were powerless, a powerlessness captured
        most evocatively in the crucifixion of Christ. Seabright doesn’t venture
        into exactly why these two faiths appealed to people in ways that others
        did not. He does, however, persuasively argue that religions succeed and
        spread because they provide “goods” that humans need and want. The data
        bear this out: religious people tend, on average, to be happier, more
        fulfilled, and more connected with their fellow citizens than those who
        do not. Take Grace, a woman Seabright meets in Ghana who is struggling
        to make ends meet but still tithes a significant portion of her income
        to a pastor who seems to be very wealthy. According to Seabright, she
        does so because she has something to gain. She acts out of a form of
        emotional self-interest. Some of the benefits of piety are tangible. As
        a member of a church of like-minded individuals, Grace can meet men who
        have the self-discipline to wake up at 9 AM on a Sunday. They must also
        be willing to invest three hours of their time to listen to a
        long-winded sermon. Obviously, finding a life partner and a potentially
        good father to her still-hypothetical children is not something that she
        can put a price tag on.
      </p>
      <p>
        但这并不能使这样的解释完全令人信服。基督教和伊斯兰教刚出现的时候，它们实际上是今天宗教市场上的沃尔玛和苹果，相对来说，这些资源很少。在他们强大之前，他们是无能为力的，这种无能为力在基督被钉在十字架上最能唤起人们的共鸣。西布赖特并没有探究为什么这两种信仰对人们有吸引力，而其他信仰却没有。然而，他确实令人信服地指出，宗教的成功和传播是因为它们提供了人类需要和想要的“商品”。数据证实了这一点:平均而言，信教的人往往比不信教的人更快乐、更充实，与同胞的联系也更紧密。以格蕾丝(Grace)为例，西布赖特在加纳遇到了一个勉强维持生计的女人，但她仍然把收入的很大一部分捐给了一位似乎非常富有的牧师。根据西布赖特的说法，她这样做是因为她有所收获。她的行为是出于某种情感上的自利。虔诚的一些好处是实实在在的。作为一个由志同道合的人组成的教堂的成员，格蕾丝可以遇到那些在周日早上9点就自律起来的人。他们还必须愿意花三个小时的时间来听一场冗长的布道。显然，为她的孩子找到一个生活伴侣和一个潜在的好父亲并不是一件她可以用价格来衡量的事情。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        And religion addresses a deeper need beyond the material. Humans are
        meaning-makers who seek, and are products of, an enchanted world. The
        secularization of societies cannot undo this. As long as people need
        meaning, religions will remain uniquely suited to provide it. Humans are
        social animals, and religions provide community in a way that secular
        ideologies can only struggle to replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        而宗教满足的是比物质更深层次的需求人类是赋予事物意义的动物我们生活在一个充满奇迹的世界里社会的世俗化无法改变这个事实只要人们还需要意义宗教就将是提供这种意义的不二法门人类是群居动物而宗教所提供的社区归属感是世俗意识形态竭力也无法复制的

        In the modern era, political ideologies have attempted to mimic the
        certainty, conviction, and mass spectacle of religion. But when they
        manage to provide those things, the sensation is usually fleeting and
        almost always susceptible to the vicissitudes of politics. People judge
        ideologies by their worldly success or failure because this world alone
        is all they have to offer. But religions have a built-in advantage: they
        are concerned with ultimate meaning in a way that secular ideologies are
        not. Communism and fascism, for example, failed in a way that
        Christianity and Islam cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
        现代意识形态竭力模仿宗教的确定性、信念和大众仪式。但意识形态即便能够提供这些东西,其影响往往也转瞬即逝,而且几乎总是难逃政治变迁的摆布。人们根据意识形态在俗世中的成败来评判它们,因为意识形态能提供的只有这个世界。但宗教具有一种内在优势:它们关注终极意义,而这正是世俗意识形态所不及的。共产主义和法西斯主义就以基督教和伊斯兰教不会有的方式失败了。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        That said, the monumental growth of Christianity and Islam in the last
        century has come not principally at the expense of secularism but rather
        of local and folk traditions—what scholars call “immanent
        religions”—around the world, particularly in Africa and parts of Latin
        America. In increasingly globalized societies, these local religions
        tend to lose out. The established, universalist faiths of Christianity
        and Islam provide the kinds of standardized ritual and support
        structures that soften the impact of rapid change and the upheaval of
        migrating from rural areas to rapidly expanding cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        但基督教和伊斯兰教在上个世纪的惊人增长主要不是以世俗主义为代价，而是以世界各地、尤其是非洲和拉丁美洲部分地区的地方和民俗传统——学者们所谓的“内在宗教”——为代价。
        在日益全球化的社会中，这些地方性宗教往往败下阵来。
        基督教和伊斯兰教等建立起来的普遍性宗教提供了标准化的仪式和支援架构，有助于缓解快速变迁以及从乡村向迅速扩张的城市迁移所造成的冲击。

      <h3>世俗化悖论</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        In the real world, the effects of losing the scaffolding that religion
        provides are clear enough. The rise of so-called deaths of despair in
        the United States has been most concentrated in the areas that have seen
        the largest decreases not in religious belief but in religious
        participation. In other words, most Americans still believe, but they
        have lost their ability to express that belief in a way that binds them
        to a wider community. So they channel it elsewhere—increasingly into
        partisan politics. It is well known that white Christians support Donald
        Trump in disproportionate numbers. Less well known is that “unchurched”
        Christians have proven particularly loyal to him. As The New York Times
        reported in January, church membership in Iowa’s Calhoun County
        plummeted by almost a third from 2010 to 2020, yet the overwhelming
        majority of its residents continued to identify as Christian. Trump
        garnered over 70 percent of the vote in the county.
      </p>
      <p>
        在现实世界中，失去宗教提供的这种支持的后果已经很明显。美国所谓“绝望之死”现象的上升，在宗教参与度而非宗教信仰下降最大的地区最为集中。换句话说，大多数美国人仍然相信宗教，但他们已经失去了以能够将他们与更广泛的社区联系起来的方式表达这种信仰的能力。于是，他们的信仰转而投向其他渠道——越来越转向两极化的政治。众所周知，白人基督徒以不成比例的高比例支持唐纳德·特朗普(Donald
        Trump)。鲜为人知的是，“无教堂”基督徒特别忠于他。如《纽约时报》(New York
        Times)今年1月报道，爱荷华州卡尔霍恩县(Calhoun
        County)的教会成员从2010年到2020年减少了近三分之一，但绝大多数居民仍自认为是基督徒。特朗普在该县获得了超过70%的选票。

        One might call this the paradox of secularization: that even if religion
        matters less for individuals, it can still matter more for society at
        large. Like love or friendship, religion can make its presence felt
        through its absence. The more secularized a society becomes, the more
        noticeable the holdouts, which is why outward displays of religiosity
        can seem so jarring in various European contexts. Across the globe,
        religion remains resonant in public life because it speaks to
        fundamental and foundational concerns that come to the fore in the
        messiness of political combat. For good or for ill, religion provides
        answers to the question of what it means to be a citizen. It can clarify
        the very purpose of politics. And it can offer citizens a deeper source
        and higher authority from which to derive their rights. If there were a
        world in which people cared only about calculating their economic
        self-interest, the power of religion would be significantly blunted. But
        the world does not quite work that way—and, if Seabright’s analysis is
        any indication, it won’t any time soon.

        这一现象可称为世俗化的悖论：即便宗教对个人来说变得不那么重要，但它对整个社会仍然可能更重要。宗教就像爱情或友情一样，其存在感可以通过缺失而凸显。一个社会越世俗化，那些坚守宗教的人就越显眼，这就是为什么在欧洲某些环境中，公开展示宗教虔诚会显得如此刺眼。在全球范围内，宗教在公共生活中仍然具有共鸣，因为它触及到政治斗争混乱状态中凸显的根本和基础性问题。无论结果好坏，宗教都为公民身份的含义提供了答案；它可以阐明政治的根本目的；它还可以为公民提供更深层次的权利来源和更高的权威。如果世界上的人只关心计算自身的经济利益，那么宗教的力量就会大打折扣。但世界并非如此运行——根据塞布赖特的分析，短期内也不会这样。
