        Does a reputation for weakness invite aggression? Many analysts have
        suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade
        Ukraine in 2022 after inferring that the United States and the rest of
        NATO lacked resolve. The West had imposed only weak sanctions on the
        Kremlin in response to its 2014 annexation of Crimea and its 2018
        poisoning of a former Russian spy in the United Kingdom. Then came the
        U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, a chaotic evacuation that
        seemed to demonstrate Washington’s lack of commitment.
      </p>
      <p>
        软弱的名声会招致攻击吗？许多分析人士认为，俄罗斯总统普京之所以在2022年入侵乌克兰，是因为他推断美国和北约其他国家缺乏决心。西方对克里姆林宫在2014年吞并克里米亚和2018年在英国毒害一名前俄罗斯间谍的反应只是实施了轻微制裁。接着，2021年美国从阿富汗混乱撤军，似乎表明华盛顿缺乏承诺。

        On the day Russia invaded, U.S. President Joe Biden declared that Putin
        launched his attack to “test the resolve of the West.” Now, many believe
        that the United States must incur significant costs—sending billions of
        dollars in military aid to Ukraine and risking nuclear escalation—in
        part to prove to Putin that it is resolute. But the audience Washington
        is performing for goes well beyond Putin. Across the world, it can seem
        as if American credibility is constantly being questioned, with the
        United States’ adversaries challenging U.S. hegemony, and its allies
        worrying whether Washington will come to their aid. The potential for
        another Trump presidency and a more isolationist approach to foreign
        policy only adds to these allies’ concerns. In the Middle East, Israeli
        Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly scorned Washington’s
        requests for restraint in his assault on the Palestinian militant group
        Hamas after its terror attack on his country last year, while Iran’s
        proxies are brazenly attacking U.S. targets. In the global South, the
        United States is struggling to convince countries to take its side in
        the emerging struggle between democracies and autocracies. “Nobody seems
        to be afraid of us,” former Defense Secretary Robert Gates lamented in a
        February interview with Foreign Affairs.

        俄罗斯出兵那天，美国总统乔·拜登宣称，普京发动袭击是为了“试探西方的决心”。如今，许多人认为，美国必须付出巨大代价——向乌克兰提供数十亿美元的军事援助，并冒着核升级的风险——部分原因是要向普京证明自己意志坚定。但华盛顿要取信的对象远不止普京。在世界各地，美国的信誉似乎不断受到质疑：美国的对手挑战其霸权，盟友则怀疑美国是否会出手相助。而唐纳德·特朗普可能再次入主白宫，并采取更孤立主义的外交政策，这只会加剧盟友的担忧。在中东，以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡去年在其国家遭受巴勒斯坦激进组织哈马斯的恐怖袭击后，反复无视华盛顿要求克制其对哈马斯的打击的请求；而伊朗的代理人则肆无忌惮地袭击美国目标。在全球南方，美国正努力说服各国在民主国家与威权国家之间日益显现的斗争中站在自己一边。“似乎没有人害怕我们，”前国防部长罗伯特·盖茨2月在《外交》杂志上哀叹道。

        Many analysts suggest that these developments are the United States’
        fault—that it has lost its once unquestioned reputation for strength and
        resolve. Regaining that reputation depends on the extent to which the
        United States is willing to support friends such as Israel and Ukraine.
        The rest of the world is watching closely, and if Washington goes soft,
        the argument runs, adversaries will feel emboldened and allies
        abandoned. China, for instance, might infer that it can invade Taiwan
        without serious consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        许多分析人士认为，这种事态发展是美国咎由自取——它已经失去了曾一度无可争议的强大力量和坚定意志的声誉。而重振这一声誉，在于美国是否愿意支持以色列和乌克兰等盟友。全世界都在密切关注，如果华盛顿表现出软弱，其论点就是对手将受到鼓舞，盟友将感到被抛弃。比如，中国可能会认为它可以入侵台湾而不必付出严重代价。

        Leaders have long obsessed over credibility, the perceived likelihood
        that a nation will follow through on its word, especially a threat to
        use military force. Washington has even gone to war—in Korea, Vietnam,
        and Iraq—to protect its credibility. Behind this consensus that
        credibility is important, however, lies a great deal of uncertainty
        about how it is established, how much it drives relations between
        states, and how it can be maintained or regained without instigating
        escalation or unwanted wars.
      </p>
      <p>
        领导人们长久以来一直对可信度念念不忘，也就是一个国家会遵守诺言的可能性，特别是实施军事力量的威胁。华盛顿甚至为了捍卫可信度出兵朝鲜、越南和伊拉克。然而，在认为可信度重要的共识背后，关于如何建立可信度、它在国与国之间的关系中起到多大驱动作用，以及如何在不引发升级或不必要的战争的情况下保持或重获可信度，还存在很多不确定性。

        Over the past decade, a new wave of research has produced fresh insights
        into credibility, particularly about what creates a reputation for
        resolve. The latest thinking shows that all else being equal,
        maintaining a reputation for resolve is important to deter adversaries
        and reassure allies. But it also suggests that leaders have far less
        influence over their country’s credibility than they might wish.
        Credibility is in the eye of the beholder, after all. It depends on the
        complex psychological calculations of one’s adversaries. Reputations are
        beliefs about beliefs, which makes them almost impossible to control.
        The implication for the United States should give policymakers pause:
        its efforts to rebuild credibility are costly, easily misread, and can
        even backfire.
      </p>
      <p>
        过去十年,一波新的研究为可信度问题提供了新见解,特别是关于如何建立强硬决心的声誉。最新的理论认为,在其他条件相同的情况下,维持强硬决心的声誉对于威慑对手和安抚盟友都很重要。但这些理论也表明,领导层对其国家可信度的影响力远小于他们所希望的。毕竟,可信度是旁观者眼中的东西,取决于对手复杂的心理计算。声誉是对信念的信念,因此几乎无法控制。这一对美国的含义应让决策者三思:其重建可信度的努力代价高昂、容易被误解,甚至可能适得其反。

      <h3>FACE OFF</h3>
      <h3>面对面</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The word “credibility” entered the international relations lexicon after
        the 1938 Munich agreement between fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, France,
        and the United Kingdom, referring to what the leaders who appeased
        Hitler lacked. Resolve—a state’s willingness to stand firm in a
        crisis—is only one component of credibility; material capabilities and
        perceived interests are also essential. But maintaining a reputation for
        resolve became much more central to American statecraft with the advent
        of the Cold War. Considering the United States’ new commitments at that
        time to defend distant allies, the global struggle between competing
        power blocs, and the existential risk of nuclear conflict, theorists
        such as Thomas Schelling contended that credibility was one of the key
        factors in deterring and prevailing against the Soviet Union. “Face is
        one of the few things worth fighting over,” he wrote in 1966.
      </p>
      <p>
        “可信性”(credibility)一词是在1938年慕尼黑协定签署后进入国际关系词汇的，用来描述那些绥靖希特勒的领导人所缺乏的东西。决断——一个国家在危机中坚守立场的意愿——只是可信性的一个组成部分，物质能力和可感知的利益也很重要。但随着冷战的爆发，维持决断力的声誉对美国的外交政策而言变得更为重要。鉴于美国当时对保卫遥远盟友的新承诺、全球两大权力集团之间的斗争，以及核战争带来的生存威胁，托马斯·谢林(Thomas
        Schelling)等理论家认为，可信性是威慑和战胜苏联的关键因素之一。“面子是值得争斗的少数东西之一，”他在1966年写道。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Schelling, whose pioneering work shaped the rationalist thinking of many
        Cold War–era U.S. presidents, emphasized that a state’s response to any
        given crisis would prove relevant in future crises, even very different
        kinds of crises, because adversaries would presume that the state would
        behave similarly. This hypothesis suggested that deterrence depended on
        sending clear messages to adversaries and sticking to prior commitments.
        And it helped motivate the United States’ containment policies during
        the Cold War, leading to a focus on peripheral regions such as
        Indochina. Although the United States had few direct interests in
        Vietnam, Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson felt that the
        United States’ reputation for resolve was being tested, and so they were
        steadily drawn into a war to defend South Vietnam from the communist
        north.
      </p>
      <p>
        冷战时期多任美国总统的理性思维深受舒尔茨先期工作的启发，他强调，一国应对特定危机的方式会适用于未来危机——即便是性质迥异的危机——因为对手会认为该国会采取类似行为。这一假设认为，威慑取决于向对手发出清晰信号以及遵守既定承诺。这在一定程度上促使美国在冷战期间采取遏制政策，导致美国将重点放在印支等边缘地区。尽管美国在越南并无重大利益，但肯尼迪和约翰逊两位总统觉得美国的决心受到了考验，因此逐步陷入到保护南越免遭共产主义北方侵略的战争中。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        After the Cold War, a second wave of scholars questioned whether a
        state’s reputation for resolve mattered at all. Because most
        international relations dilemmas incorporate new considerations and
        unique sets of stakes, Daryl Press has argued that, when predicting a
        state’s future actions, analyzing its “current calculus” of interests
        and capabilities is far more useful than scrutinizing its past behavior.
        Jonathan Mercer has argued that reputations for resolve are hard to
        build. Moreover, they are subjective: leaders are more likely to believe
        their adversaries are resolute and their allies are weak-willed.
      </p>
      <p>
        冷战结束后，一批学者质疑一国决心的声誉是否真的重要。达利·普雷斯认为，由于多数国际关系困境都涉及新的考量和独特的风险组合，因此在预测一个国家未来行为时，分析其当前的利益和能力计算，要比研究其过去的行为有用得多。乔纳森·默瑟则认为，强硬声誉很难树立。而且这种声誉是主观的：领导人往往认为对手意志坚定，盟友则软弱可欺。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        This post–Cold War school of thought contended that because states judge
        other states’ reputations subjectively and reputation does not appear to
        predict current behavior, reputation may not be worth fighting for. This
        view became more influential among U.S. policymakers over the course of
        the United States’ long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as some began to
        question whether Washington was mainly staying the course for
        reputation’s sake—and if it was really gaining anything by the effort to
        sustain its reputation for resolve. President Barack Obama defended his
        decision not to attack Syria after Bashar al-Assad’s regime used
        chemical weapons in 2013, crossing a redline he himself had set, by
        saying in 2016, “Dropping bombs on someone to prove that you’re willing
        to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force.”
      </p>
      <p>
        冷战后的这一学派认为，由于各国对其他国家的声誉作出主观判断，而声誉似乎也不能预示当前行为，因此声誉可能不值得去争取。随着美国深陷阿富汗和伊拉克战争，这一观点在美国决策者中越来越有市场，他们开始质疑华盛顿是否只是为了声誉而坚守，以及这样做是否真的能维持其决断力的声誉。2013年巴沙尔·阿萨德政权使用化学武器、跨越了奥巴马自己划定的红线之后，奥巴马在2016年为他当年决定不打击叙利亚辩护说，“为了证明你愿意动用武力而去轰炸别人，大概是最糟糕的使用武力理由。”

      <h3>THE SCIENCE OF RESOLVE</h3>
      <h3>决心的科学</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Over the last decade, a new generation of scholars has employed fresh
        statistical methods, textual analyses of newly declassified government
        records, and survey-based experiments to bring an even more nuanced
        examination to how reputation shapes international relations, charting a
        middle path between those who think credibility is the be-all and
        end-all in foreign affairs and those who think it does not matter. All
        else being equal, it is becoming clearer that if a state has a
        reputation for resolve, that does change its adversaries’ behavior. For
        example, Alex Weisiger and I found in a 2015 study that countries that
        had backed down in a crisis were more than twice as likely to face
        challenges the following year than countries that had stood firm.
      </p>
      <p>
        过去十年间,新一代学者利用新的统计方法、对新解密的政府档案进行文本分析以及基于调查的实验,对声誉如何塑造国际关系进行了更为细致的考察,在认为信誉是外交政策一切的人和认为信誉无关紧要的人之间探索一条中间道路。在其他条件相同的情况下,如果一个国家有坚定立场的声誉,这确实会改变对手的行为。例如,亚历克斯·韦西格(Alex
        Weisiger)和我2015年的一项研究发现,在危机中退缩的国家,第二年面临挑战的可能性是没有退缩的国家的两倍多。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Yet signaling resolve can be harder than it seems. Repeated
        demonstrations of resolve can become rote over time and lose their
        force—or even be counterproductive. The United States prosecuted the
        Vietnam War in part to show its resolve to contain communism. But by
        making subsequent presidents wary of entangling Washington in far-flung
        conflicts, the war may have dampened that resolve and made future
        interventions much less likely—an aversion that came to be known as
        “Vietnam syndrome.”
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，展示决心往往比看上去要困难。多次展现决心可能会流于表面，逐渐失去影响力，甚至适得其反。美国发动越南战争，在一定程度上是为了显示遏制共产主义的决心。但那场战争可能削弱了后续政府的干预意愿，使得后来的军事干预可能性大为降低——这种规避行为被称为“越战综合征”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Van Jackson’s research has also demonstrated that because a state’s
        commitments are multifaceted, an effort to prove one form of
        determination may weaken a reputation for other kinds. For instance,
        North Korea’s frequent threats over the course of its crises with the
        United States helped it establish a reputation for resolve. But when it
        failed to follow through, the same threats gave it a reputation for
        inconsistency and dishonesty. In seeking to show toughness, North Korea
        proved its fickleness.
      </p>
      <p>
        瓦南·杰克逊的研究也表明，因为国家的承诺是多方面的，所以努力证明一种决心可能会损害其在其他方面的声誉。比如，朝鲜在与美国的多次危机中发出的频繁威胁，有助于树立它的强硬形象。但当它未能兑现威胁时，这些威胁反而使它得了个反复无常和不讲信用的名声。在试图表现强硬时，朝鲜反而暴露了自己的不可靠。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The greatest paradox the new wave of research identified, however, is
        that a state’s reputation is not in its own hands. Reputations depend on
        who is assessing them. My own research has found that leaders display
        selective attention, giving information that stands out to them—such as
        their personal impressions of their counterparts—greater weight than
        other indicators that may be equally or more relevant. In a similar 2022
        study, Don Casler also found that policymakers adjudicate credibility
        differently depending on their experiences and roles. Intelligence and
        military officials, for instance, tend to focus on a state’s current
        capabilities, whereas diplomats focus more on the consistency (or lack
        thereof) of its leaders’ behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        但新一波研究发现的最讽刺的现象是，一个国家的声誉其实并不由自己掌控。声誉是由评价者决定的。我自己的研究发现，各国领导人特别重视那些能引起他们注意的信息——比如他们对对手的个人印象——而其他可能同样重要或更重要的指标则被赋予较少权重。唐·卡斯勒(Don
        Casler)在2022年的一项类似研究中也发现，政策制定者根据其经历和角色的不同，判断可信度的标准也会不同：情报和军事官员往往关注一个国家当前的能力，而外交官则更关注领导人的行为是否前后一致。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Beliefs matter, too. The recent scholarship on credibility suggests that
        one actor’s assessment of another is profoundly shaped by irrational
        forces such as confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and ideological
        predisposition. For instance, a 2018 study by Joshua Kertzer, Jonathan
        Renshon, and I found that hawkish policymakers perceive public threats
        as less credible than their dovish counterparts do and are more inclined
        to view actions such as military mobilizations as credible signals of
        resolve. A similar study by Kertzer, Brian Rathbun, and Nina Srinivasan
        Rathbun found that hawks are more likely than doves to view their
        adversaries’ promises to comply with agreements as lacking credibility,
        suggesting that existing beliefs color assessments. As former Secretary
        of State Mike Pompeo said of the Iranians as Trump prepared to withdraw
        from Obama’s nuclear deal, “We know they’re cheating. . . . We’re just
        not seeing it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        信念也很重要。有关可信度的最新研究表明，一方对另一方的评估在很大程度上受到确认偏见、有动机的推理和意识形态倾向等非理性力量的深刻影响。例如，我和乔舒亚·柯特泽(Joshua
        Kertzer)及乔纳森·伦肖恩(Jonathan
        Renshon)2018年进行的一项研究发现，强硬派政策制定者认为公共威胁不如鸽派同行认为的那样可信，他们更倾向于将军事动员之类的行动视为决心的可信信号。柯特泽与布莱恩·拉斯邦(Brian
        Rathbun)及尼娜·斯里尼瓦桑·拉斯邦(Nina Srinivasan
        Rathbun)的类似研究发现，强硬派比鸽派更有可能认为对手遵守协议的承诺不可信，这表明现有信念会影响评估。正如特朗普准备退出奥巴马的核协议时，时任国务卿蓬佩奥对伊朗人所说的那样，“我们知道他们在作弊……只是我们没有看到证据。”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Or consider the United States’ pullout from Afghanistan in 2021. Those
        who cared about the overall reputation of the United States might have
        concluded that the withdrawal and its chaotic execution showed
        adversaries that the country lacks resolve. But those more concerned
        about the consistency of its promises and its actions—maintaining what
        is known as a strong “signaling reputation”—would say the withdrawal
        revealed high credibility. Biden, after all, followed through on a
        campaign promise to pull U.S. forces out of Afghanistan, signaling that
        he keeps his word.
      </p>
      <p>
        或者以美国于2021年从阿富汗撤军为例。关心美国整体声誉的人可能会认为，那次撤军及其混乱的执行方式向对手显示了美国缺乏意志力。但更关心美国承诺与行动一致性——即保持所谓的强大“信誉信号”——的人则会说，那次撤军显示出美国具有高度可信度。毕竟，拜登兑现了撤出驻阿美军的竞选承诺，发出了他会遵守诺言的信号。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Adding to the complexity, observers do not judge resolve based only on
        what a leader does; they also judge it based on what they think the
        leader thinks about what he does. In 1969, after North Korea shot down a
        U.S. reconnaissance aircraft, killing 31 Americans, the United States
        chose not to retaliate. U.S. Secretary of State William Rogers attempted
        to frame this nonresponse as a sign of American strength: “The weak can
        be rash. The powerful must be more restrained.” If observers thought
        Rogers truly meant what he said, then the decision not to retaliate
        could have bolstered the United States’ reputation for resolve. But if
        observers believed Rogers was trying to dress up weakness with powerful
        rhetoric, or that the United States had chosen not to retaliate purely
        to send a signal about its reputation, they may have discounted the
        statement entirely. This is what the scholar Robert Jervis called “the
        reputation paradox.” Ultimately, how people calculate someone’s
        intentions reflects their own biases.
      </p>
      <p>
        而且，判断耐力不仅要看领导人的实际作为，还要看他们认为领导人对其所作所为的看法。1969年，朝鲜击落一架美国侦察机，造成31名美国人丧生，美国没有选择报复。国务卿威廉·罗杰斯(William
        Rogers)试图将这种不作为解释为美国力量的体现：“弱者可能轻率行事。强者必须更加克制。”如果观察家们相信罗杰斯说的是真心话，那么不报复的决定反而可能增强了美国的耐力声誉。但如果人们认为罗杰斯只是在用豪言壮语掩饰软弱，或者认为美国不报复只是为了炫耀自己的名声，他们可能完全不会把这当回事。这就是学者罗伯特·杰维斯(Robert
        Jervis)所谓的“声誉悖论”。归根结底，人们对他人意图的解读反映了他们自身的偏见。

      <p>
        Debates about credibility, or more specifically reputations for resolve,
        are now playing a major role in the latest outbreak of violence in the
        Middle East. One reading of that conflict suggests that the decline of
        American credibility in the region—thanks to the bungled Iraq war, the
        failure to follow through on the redline with Syria, and the rushed
        withdrawal from Afghanistan—directly contributed to a credibility
        deficit that may have emboldened Iran and its proxies, including Hamas.
        A converse theory suggests that Iran and its proxies rated U.S.
        credibility highly and hoped that if they attacked a U.S. ally,
        Washington would be forced to respond and get dragged into a costly war.
      </p>
      <p>
        关于可信度的辩论，或者更具体地说是关于决心的声誉，现在正在最近一轮中东暴力冲突中发挥主要作用。对这场冲突的一种解读认为，由于伊拉克战争的拙劣操作、未能对叙利亚划出红线以及仓促从阿富汗撤军，美国在该地区的可信度下降，这直接导致了一个可信度赤字，可能鼓舞了伊朗及其代理人，包括哈马斯。相反的观点则认为，伊朗及其代理人高度评价美国的可信度，因此他们希望如果攻击美国的盟友，华盛顿就会被迫回应，并被拖入一场代价高昂的战争。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        These narratives may have elements of truth. But they assume qualities
        about the United States’ adversaries that are almost impossible to know,
        such as which dots Iranian or Hamas leaders connected to form their
        assessments of U.S. resolve. After Israel scored a decisive win in its
        2006 war with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia’s leader, Hassan
        Nasrallah, acknowledged that had he known Israel would respond with so
        much force, he would never have kidnapped the two Israeli soldiers whose
        capture triggered the war. It is unlikely the leaders of Hamas or Iran
        will make a similar declaration—and if they did, it might not accurately
        reflect whether the United States’ credibility deficit factored into
        their calculus. Even if these leaders plainly and publicly declared how
        their perception of U.S. resolve influenced their decision-making, such
        statements may be merely performative. Policymakers must apply great
        caution when concluding, first, that they understand how adversaries
        perceive their country and, second, that this perception clearly
        motivated a certain action.

        这些说法可能包含了一些事实的成分。但它们对美国对手的假设几乎无法证实，比如伊朗或哈马斯领导人如何判断美国的决心。在2006年与真主党的战争中取得压倒性胜利后，黎巴嫩真主党领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉承认，如果他事先知道以色列会如此强硬地报复，他就不会绑架两名引发冲突的以色列士兵。哈马斯或伊朗的领导人不太可能做出类似的承认——即使他们真的这么做，也不一定能准确反映出美国的可信度是否影响了他们的决策。就算这些领导人公开坦率地说明了他们对美国决心的认知是如何影响其决策的，这种表述也可能只是表面文章。政策制定者在得出结论之前必须格外谨慎：首先，他们认为自己了解对手如何看待自己的国家；其次，这种认知明显地驱使了对方采取某种行动。

        In fact, Hamas’s October 7 attack may have had nothing to do with
        Washington’s reputation. It could simply be explained by the failure of
        Israeli deterrence attributable to local factors such as the prospect of
        an Israeli-Saudi normalization deal and turmoil in Israel’s domestic
        politics. Likewise, Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine may have had
        everything to do with his psychology—his megalomania, his aspiration to
        restore Russia’s lost grandeur. By blaming so much global disorder on a
        U.S. credibility gap, analysts can easily overstate Washington’s ability
        to shape world events.
      </p>
      <p>
        事实上，哈马斯10月7日的袭击可能与美国的声誉无关，而是由于以色列威慑力的失败，这可归因于地方性因素，比如可能出现的以色列-沙特关系正常化，以及以色列国内政治的动荡。同样，普京入侵乌克兰可能完全是因为他的心理——他的妄自尊大，他恢复俄罗斯昔日辉煌的抱负。如果分析人士将如此多的全球混乱归咎于美国的信誉赤字，他们很容易夸大华盛顿塑造世界事件的能力。

        The American credibility deficit is also frequently invoked to account
        for China’s growing belligerence. A common argument is that a U.S.
        failure to support Ukraine will signal to Chinese leader Xi Jinping that
        the United States’ commitment to supporting smaller allies is
        fundamentally softening, thus making China’s invasion of Taiwan more
        likely. But only Xi fully knows how much the war in Ukraine factors into
        his calculations. Actions don’t always speak for themselves, as Jervis
        has noted.

        美国的信誉赤字也经常被用来解释中国日益增长的好战性。正如杰维斯所指出的那样，行动并不总是能为自己说话。

        It is essential for U.S. leaders to avoid being trapped by their
        anxieties about credibility. In the end, it matters little how the
        United States assesses its own reputation for resolve. What matters far
        more is how observers—its adversaries and allies—judge it, which is hard
        for the United States to control. The current obsession with fixing the
        United States’ credibility deficit may not only be fruitless; it also
        carries substantial risk. If Americans come to the consensus that a
        credibility crisis is to blame for the world’s disorder, they are likely
        to conclude that their opponents will be more willing to challenge U.S.
        interests, which invites more hawkish U.S. policy and costlier
        signaling. This signaling, in turn, could provoke unnecessary crises,
        arms races, and even wars.

        对美国领导人来说，至关重要的是不要被自己对可信度的焦虑所困。归根结底，美国如何评估自身的决心并不重要。更重要的是——无论是对手还是盟友——外界如何评判美国，而这往往不在美国控制之下。美国如今对修补可信度赤字的痴迷可能不仅徒劳无功，而且风险巨大。如果美国人一致认为世界失序是可信度危机造成的，他们可能会认为对手更愿意挑战美国利益，从而导致美国采取更为强硬的政策，发出代价高昂的信号。而这些信号反过来又可能引发不必要的危机、军备竞赛甚至战争。

        Of course, Washington must make its threats as credible as possible,
        reassure its allies, and demonstrate that contested areas—such as
        Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine—are of vital concern. But states and leaders
        have a wider menu of options to build credibility than some policymakers
        recognize: public methods, private methods, and a combination of the
        two. Sending military aid or moving aircraft carriers can signal
        resolve. So can taking steps to avoid undermining American credibility,
        such as not publicly broadcasting the United States’ intent to “pivot”
        away from a region or publicly delineating redlines it will be unwilling
        to enforce. In general, those who suggest the United States faces a
        credibility deficit tend to put far too much emphasis on the country’s
        past actions. The past matters, but what matters more is the credibility
        of the signals Washington is sending right now.

        当然，美国必须尽可能地使自己的威胁具有可信度，安抚其盟友，并表明对以色列、台湾和乌克兰等争议地区有着深切的关注。但是，政策制定者往往忽视了构建可信度的各种可用手段：公开的或私下的，以及两者的结合。提供军事援助或派遣航空母舰可以显示决心。同样，不公开宣布美国将“转向”远离某个地区，或者不划出它自己也无法执行的红线，也是避免损害美国可信度的举措。一般而言，认为美国可信度下降的人往往过于强调美国过去的行为。历史确实重要，但更重要的是华盛顿现在发出的信号的可信度。

        U.S. policymakers also sometimes excessively globalize credibility by
        presuming that every country around the world perceives the United
        States’ actions in the same way and takes a single message from U.S.
        foreign policy, even policies the United States has applied in a
        completely different region. In truth, the vantage points from which
        other countries form their perceptions of the United States vary widely,
        depending on those countries’ local situations and their leaders’
        psychologies. Policymakers must carefully analyze the psychologies of
        the United States’ diverse adversaries—otherwise, even costly signaling
        may not have the desired effect. There is no one-size-fits-all approach
        to signaling resolve or maintaining deterrence.
      </p>

        美国政策制定者有时也过度全球化可信度，认为全世界各国都以相同方式解读美国的行为，从美国的外交政策(即便这些政策是在完全不同的地区推行的)中得出单一信息。事实上，其他国家根据各自的情况和领导人的心理，对美国形成看法的角度多种多样。政策制定者必须仔细分析美国不同对手的心理——否则，即便是代价高昂的信号也可能达不到预期效果。展示决心或维持威慑并没有放之四海而皆准的方法。

        Adversaries may not even pay the most attention to what the United
        States does overseas. They may more closely follow its domestic
        politics. More than any action the United States did or did not
        undertake abroad, it may well have been American political polarization
        that most encouraged Putin to test Washington’s resolve to defend Kyiv.
        Recent research suggests that when presidents show resolve in domestic
        crises, they can build their reputations internationally. Soviet
        leaders’ opinion of President Ronald Reagan’s resolve was bolstered by a
        domestic act—his firing of air traffic controllers for going on strike
        in 1981. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that he
        was impressed by Kennedy’s resolve to seek a negotiated settlement to
        the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. But what impressed him was not how the
        president behaved toward Moscow but his willingness to overrule the
        advice of his own military leaders to avert a catastrophe.
      </p>
      <p>
        敌人也许根本不会太在意美国在海外的举动，他们更关注美国国内政治。如果说有什么鼓励普京试探美国捍卫基辅的决心，那很可能是美国的政治极化。有研究表明，总统在国内危机中表现出强硬，能够提升其国际声誉。比如，罗纳德·里根总统在1981年解雇因罢工而停摆的空管人员，这一国内举动加强了苏联领导人对他在国际事务中强硬立场的认识。尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫在其回忆录中提到，肯尼迪总统在1962年古巴导弹危机中展现出的通过谈判解决问题的决心给他留下了深刻印象。但让他印象深刻之处并非肯尼迪对莫斯科的立场，而是他愿意违抗军方高层的建议以避免灾难发生。

        A reputation for resolve is one of the hardest things for leaders or
        states to control. Any assessment of U.S. adversaries that does not
        carefully examine their psychology—the different ways they come to
        conclusions about the United States—is doomed to be inadequate. And
        ultimately, to regain credibility abroad, the United States may first
        need to tackle an even more complicated task: restoring unity at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        对决心的预期是领导人或国家最难控制的因素之一。如果不仔细研究美国对手的心理——他们得出有关美国的结论所采用的不同方式——那么对美国对手的任何评估都将注定流于表面。最终，为了重塑国际信誉，美国或许需要首先完成一项更为艰巨的任务：在国内恢复团结。
