        The world’s 190-odd nation-states are home to 7,168 “living languages,”
        according to the latest figure from Ethnologue, a widely used language
        database. The implications of this enormous disproportion are obvious,
        given that few governments support more than one or a handful of
        official languages. The vast majority of languages represent communities
        that are much older and more localized than nation-states, and the
        mismatch between states and languages is at least one driver of a
        planet-wide shift in human consciousness: the staggering loss of
        linguistic diversity.

        根据广泛使用的语言数据库《世界语言》(Ethnologue)的最新数据，全球190多个民族国家是7168种“活生生的语言”的故乡。考虑到很少有政府支持一种以上或少数几种官方语言，这种巨大的不平衡意味着什么，不言而喻。绝大多数语言代表着比民族国家更为古老和地域性更强的社区，而国家与语言之间的错配至少是全球人类意识转变的一个驱动因素：语言多样性正以前所未有的速度消失。

        Linguists consider at least half of all human languages to be
        endangered. Already most of these tongues have under 10,000 speakers,
        whereas hundreds have fewer than ten, and many are thought to have just
        one. (The situation is particularly dire for the world’s 157 sign
        languages, as tallied by Ethnologue.) Speakers of Arabic, English,
        French, Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, and Spanish are legion, while
        lesser-known tongues dwindle away. According to one estimate, 96 percent
        of the world’s population speaks just four percent of all languages,
        which means that the striking obverse is also true: just four percent of
        the world’s population speaks 96 percent of all languages. Like
        biodiversity, linguistic diversity is not evenly distributed, remaining
        strongest in “hotspots” such as Papua New Guinea, equatorial Africa, the
        Amazon, and the Himalayas, all places where, at least until recently,
        topography, subsistence economies, and distance from centralized states
        have helped smaller language groups survive. The new language hotspots
        today are in cities that are migrant hubs such as Jakarta, Lagos,
        London, New York, and Paris, where peoples from all over increasingly
        cluster for work, education, access to services, a chance for survival,
        and a taste of modern life. Today’s New York is the most linguistically
        diverse city not only in the world but in the history of the world, but
        the survival of linguistic diversity in such crucibles of contact is far
        from assured.

        语言学家认为，世界上至少有一半的语言都处于危险之中。许多语言的使用者已不足万人，有数百种语言的使用者甚至不足十人。据《民族语》(Ethnologue)记载，全球有157种手语的境况尤其堪忧。
        相比之下，说阿拉伯语、英语、法语、印地语、普通话和西班牙语的人则不计其数，而使用较少听说的语言的人口则在不断减少。据估计，全球96%的人口只会说所有语言中的4%，这意味着另一个同样令人震惊的事实：全球4%的人口会说所有语言的96%。
        和生物多样性一样，语言多样性在全球的分布并不均匀，它在巴布亚新几内亚、赤道非洲、亚马逊地区和喜马拉雅山脉等“热点”地区最为丰富。这些地方之所以能保持语言多样性，至少在近期内，是因为地形、生存经济和远离中央集权国家等因素帮助较小的语言群体得以存活。
        如今，雅加达、拉各斯、伦敦、纽约和巴黎等移民中心城市的语言多样性成为新的热点。来自世界各地的人们为了工作、教育、获取服务、求生以及体验现代生活而聚集在这里。
        如今的纽约不仅是全球语言最多元的城市，而且是有史以来语言最多元的城市。但这种接触熔炉中的语言多样性能否延续，远未可知。

        Languages have always come and gone—and sometimes even languages with
        very small numbers of speakers have survived for generations—but the
        current rate of loss is unprecedented. In many ways, it is parallel to
        the planet’s accelerating loss of animal and plant species. Arguably, it
        started with the millennia-long, ongoing spread of agriculture, which
        enabled certain language groups to increase in number, take new
        territories, and dominate smaller-scale and more linguistically diverse
        hunter-gatherer and nomadic groups. In recent centuries, the conquests
        of colonial empires, hyper-urbanization, the ever-expanding networks of
        capitalism, and the monolingual imperatives of nation-states have all
        driven the vanishing of languages. The spread of formal education
        systems and new forms of media and communications also make it harder
        for smaller languages to hang on in a changing world.
      </p>

        语言的兴衰并非新鲜事——有些只被少数人使用的语言也存活了数个世纪——但目前的语言消失速度史无前例。在很多方面，它与地球动物和植物物种加速灭绝的趋势类似。有人认为，这一切始于农业的长期传播，它让某些语言群体的人数增加，占领新领土，并统治规模较小、语言更多样的狩猎采集者和游牧群体。近几个世纪以来，殖民帝国的征服、超城市化、资本主义不断扩张的网络以及民族国家的单一语言指令，都导致了语言的消失。正规教育体系的普及和新型媒体及通讯形式的出现，也让小语种在不断变化的世界中更难以存续。

        Speakers of dominant languages often shrug at the disappearance of these
        smaller languages. After all, they wonder, wouldn’t the world be a
        better place if everybody understood one another? That kind of thinking
        not only forgets that speakers of the same language are perfectly
        capable of fighting and killing one another but also completely
        overlooks the scientific, artistic, and deeply human benefits of
        linguistic diversity. In A Myriad of Tongues: How Languages Reveal
        Differences in How We Think, the anthropological linguist Caleb Everett
        dwells on the richness of the world’s disappearing tongues. Far from
        being primitive dialects, endangered languages teem with oral
        literature, historical and scientific knowledge, unique linguistic
        features, and other wonders that can rarely be fully translated into
        other languages. A growing body of research also shows that it is best
        for children to be educated in their mother tongue and that maintaining
        one’s mother tongue can even be good for one’s mental and physical
        health. Preserving languages can also be a matter of justice, given the
        history of displacement, persecution, and marginalization of most
        speakers of endangered languages.

        讲主导语言的人常常对这些较小语种的消失无动于衷。毕竟，他们心想，如果大家都能相互理解，这个世界岂不是会变得更好？这种想法不仅忘记了说同一种语言的人完全可能彼此争斗和厮杀，还完全忽视了语言多样性在科学、艺术和人类发展方面的深远意义。人类学语言学家凯莱布·埃弗雷特(Caleb
        Everett)在《千言万语：语言如何揭示我们思考方式的差异》(In A Myriad of
        Tongues: How Languages Reveal Differences in How We
        Think)一书中探讨了世界正在消亡的语言的丰富性。这些语言远非原始方言，而是充满了口述文学、历史和科学知识、独特的语言特征以及其他无法完全译成其他语言的奇迹。越来越多的研究还表明，儿童最好用母语接受教育，保持母语甚至对身心健康有益。考虑到大多数濒危语言使用者的历史流离失所、迫害和边缘化经历，保护这些语言也关乎正义。

        The demise of any language is not inevitable. With the political support
        of local or national governments and the devotion of sufficient economic
        resources, every language can handle all the threats, temptations, and
        communicative demands that come with both the homogenizing of national
        identities and the pressures of globalization. But most languages do not
        enjoy that kind of backing. Extraordinary economic, political, and
        social strains produce ruptures in intergenerational language
        transmission as young people cease to speak the way their elders do.
        Speakers of a language begin to feel out of place in the world; it is
        not just that access to jobs, schools, and other opportunities are tied
        to dominant languages such as English, Mandarin, and Spanish but also
        that speakers of tongues such as Cree, Nahuatl, and Zhuang have
        continually been made to feel ashamed of what and how they speak and, by
        extension, of who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        任何一种语言的消亡都不是不可避免的。只要得到地方政府或中央政府的政治支持，并投入足够的经济资源，每一种语言都能应对国家认同同质化以及全球化带来的所有威胁、诱惑和沟通需求。但大多数语言都得不到这样的支持。非凡的经济、政治和社会压力会打断代际间的语言传承，年轻人不再像他们的长辈那样说话。语言使用者开始觉得在世界上格格不入；这不仅是因为找工作、上学和其他机会都与英语、普通话和西班牙语等主导语言挂钩，还因为克里语、纳瓦特尔语和壮语等语言的使用者不断被羞辱，他们为自己说什么、怎么说，以及由此延伸出的自我认知，感到羞愧。

        Such languages face an uphill battle to survive, never mind to flourish.
        It is precisely the endangered half of the world’s languages about which
        the least is known, with few if any books or recordings to document most
        of them—sometimes little beyond a bare list of words. Only in the past
        few decades has there been a serious organized effort even among
        linguists (often a step behind missionaries) to document endangered
        languages and develop a set of practices, protocols, and tools for the
        purpose. At the same time, speakers of small and endangered languages
        are not sitting idly by. Hundreds of communities around the world have
        started trying to reclaim or revitalize their languages—a new global
        movement with major political implications of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        这些语言要生存下来都很艰难，更别提兴盛了。世界上的濒危语言大多鲜为人知，几乎没有书籍或录音来记录它们——有时候，除了词汇表之外，就一无所有了。直到最近几十年，就连语言学家（他们常常落后于传教士）才开始认真有组织地记录濒危语言，并为此制定一套做法、规程和工具。与此同时，小语种和濒危语言的使用者并非无所作为。全球各地有数百个社区开始尝试复兴或振兴自己的语言——这是一场具有重大政治意义的全球运动。

        In A Myriad of Tongues, Everett sketches the tremendous diversity of the
        world’s languages. Most belong to one of hundreds of overarching
        language families, including Austronesian, Indo-European (which includes
        English), and Niger-Congo. But there are also well over a hundred
        language “isolates” with no proven connection to any other known
        language. Although language families trace common descent from a
        putative protolanguage typically thousands of years in the past,
        languages also develop features and structures independently or change
        through contact with other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        在《千言万语》一书中，埃弗雷特概述了世界上语言的极大多样性。大多数语言属于上百个更大的语系之一，包括南岛语系、印欧语系（英语即属此类）和尼日尔-刚果语系。但也有超过一百种语言“孤岛”，与任何已知语言都未被证实有所关联。尽管各种语系通常可追溯到成千上万年前的共同祖先语言，但语言也会独立发展特征和结构，或者通过与其他语言接触而发生变化。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Everett offers a sophisticated account of how researchers, by finally
        beginning to draw on a more representative sample of the world’s
        languages, are making connections between language, thought, and “other
        aspects of the human experience.” Among the more ineffable things that
        the world stands to lose with diminishing linguistic diversity are the
        subtly but significantly different ways that human groups have of
        inhabiting and understanding their natural and social worlds. Languages
        do not simply offer different labels for the same universal set of items
        and concepts, with translation always bridging the gap. There may be
        cross-linguistic tendencies and commonalities, but there is no single
        language we can call Earthling, no linguistic “view from nowhere.” Every
        language carries within it the grain of a particular place and history.
      </p>
      <p>
        埃弗雷特提供了一个复杂的理论，解释了研究人员如何开始更多地利用世界上各种语言的样本，从而建立起语言、思维以及“人类其他体验”之间的联系。随着语言多样性的减少，世界将失去的更难以言表的东西之一是，不同人类群体对自然和社会世界的居住方式和理解方式的微妙而重大的差异。语言并不仅仅为普世的一系列事物和概念提供了不同的标签，可以随时通过翻译来弥合差异。语言之间可能存在倾向性和共性，但没有一种我们称之为“地球语”的单一语言，没有一种无所不在的语言视角。每种语言都蕴含着特定地域和历史的痕迹。

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Different languages, suggests Everett, encode and affect “the human
        cognitive experience” in different ways. With careful phrasing and an
        emphasis on empirical evidence, he sidesteps addressing in a definitive
        way one of the classic controversies of linguistics, about what is known
        as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis—that “languages have strong effects on
        their speakers’ nonlinguistic thoughts,” as Everett puts it. In other
        words, people do not just think in a given language; that language
        shapes the way they think. The debate over whether this is indeed true
        has raged for nearly a century, with many nonlinguists discerning a
        kernel of common sense in the proposition even as most linguists have
        resisted what they see as a largely untestable and oversimplifying
        claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        埃弗雷特认为，不同的语言以不同的方式编码并影响“人类的认知体验”。他措辞谨慎，强调实证证据，从而巧妙地避开了一个经典的语言学争议，即所谓萨丕尔-沃夫假说(Sapir-Whorf
        hypothesis)——用他的话来说就是，“语言对说话者的非语言思维有强烈影响”。换句话说，人们不只是用特定的语言思考；语言还塑造他们的思维方式。关于这一说法是否正确的争论已经持续了近一个世纪，许多非语言学家即便在大多数语言学家抵制这一在他们看来基本上无法检验、过于简化的主张时，仍认为其中蕴含着某种常识。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Until recently, that is. Everett draws on dozens of recent studies that
        point to languages’ deeply divergent ways of handling time, space, and
        relationships, among other central human preoccupations, and to how
        these may linger in minds and cultures beyond the moment of speech. More
        speculatively, he also sees intriguing connections between linguistic
        features and certain natural environments and associated manners of
        living, or lifeways. In other words, the old saw that the Inuit people
        have 50 words for snow may be wildly exaggerated (the original
        observation by the anthropologist Franz Boas isolated only four ways of
        describing snow), but there is something to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        情况直到最近才有所改观。埃弗雷特援引了数十项近期研究，这些研究表明，不同的语言在处理时间、空间和人际关系等人类基本关注点时有着根本的不同方式，而且这些方式可能会超越说话的瞬间，在人们的思维和文化中保留下来。更为推测性的是，他还看到了语言特征与某些自然环境及与之相关的生存方式之间饶有趣味的联系。换句话说，因纽特人有五十个表示雪的词这一老生常谈可能被极大地夸大了（人类学家弗朗茨·博厄斯最初的观察只发现了四种描述雪的方式），但其中确实有些道理。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Take time, for instance. The linguist Benjamin Whorf (of the Sapir-Whorf
        hypothesis) claimed that the Hopi language in what is now Arizona has no
        words referring to time, suggesting that Hopi speakers as a result might
        not experience time in the same way as, for example, English speakers.
        Whatever the (hotly debated) facts may be in Hopi, it is manifestly true
        that many languages large and small either dispense with tense
        altogether or encode something other than a division into past, present,
        and future. Karitiana, an Amazonian language that Everett researches,
        distinguishes only two tenses: future and nonfuture, the latter mingling
        both past and present. Yagua, also spoken in the Amazon, has eight
        tenses, five of which are for different periods in the past. To speak
        Yagua well, one needs to make fine distinctions about timing—for
        example, attaching the suffix -siymaa to verbs to mean “between
        approximately one week and one month ago.”
      </p>
      <p>
        以时间为例。语言学家本杰明·沃夫(本杰明·沃夫假说的提出者)曾宣称，如今亚利桑那州的霍皮语没有指代时间的词汇，这或许意味着说霍皮语的人体验时间的方式与说英语的人不同。不管霍皮语的真实情况(争论激烈)如何，许多大大小小的语言要么完全不使用时态，要么表达的不是过去、现在和未来的划分，这一点显而易见。埃弗雷特研究的一种亚马逊语言卡里提安娜语只有两种时态：将来时和非将来时，后者把过去和现在混为一谈。同样在亚马逊地区使用的亚瓜语有八种时态，其中五种表示过去的不同阶段。要流利地说亚瓜语，就需要对时间做出精细的区分——例如，在动词后加上后缀-siymaa，表示“大约一周到一个月前”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        More intricate still are the many metaphors for time in different
        languages. Where English speakers see the future as being spatially
        ahead or in front of them, speakers of Aymara in Bolivia and Peru see
        the future as being behind them and the past in front, as in the
        expression nayra mara, which is literally “the year I can see” but
        figuratively “last year.” Associated gestures are an indication that
        such expressions may seep into thought. Whereas English speakers often
        point backward in discussing the past, Aymara speakers do the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
        更复杂的是不同语言中对时间的许多隐喻。说英语的人认为未来在空间上在前面或在前面，而说玻利维亚和秘鲁艾马拉语的人则认为未来在他们身后，过去在他们前面，就像表达nayra
        mara一样，字面意思是“我能看到的那一年”，比喻意义是“去年”。相关的手势表明这种表达可能会渗透到思想中。说英语的人在讨论过去时经常向后指，而说艾马拉语的人则相反。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Such cases multiply when it comes to space, color, and noun
        categorization, including by kinship, gender, and shape. For instance,
        speakers of the Berinmo language of Papua New Guinea have the word nol
        for what English speakers call green and blue. (Indeed, many languages
        have such a “grue” color.) Berinmo speakers also have the word wor,
        which covers English speakers’ yellows and bright greens. An experiment
        testing the ability of Berinmo and English speakers to recall different
        color chips found that each group did better with chips that aligned
        clearly in terms of their respective linguistic categories for
        understanding colors, compared with chips whose color was more
        ambiguous. This is language-based categorical perception, in which
        “people discriminate stimuli more neatly because the stimuli fall into
        distinct conceptual categories,” according to Everett.
      </p>
      <p>
        在对空间、颜色和名词分类（包括亲属关系、性别和形状）的描述上，这种例子不胜枚举。例如，巴布亚新几内亚伯尼莫语(Berinmo)使用者有一个词nol，对应英语中的green和blue（事实上，许多语言都有类似的“蓝绿色”）。他们还有一个词wor，对应英语使用者所说的yellow和亮green。一个测试伯尼莫语和英语使用者识别不同色块能力的实验发现，相比颜色较为模糊的色块，每种语言的使用者都能更好地记住那些更符合自己语言中颜色分类的色块。这是基于语言的概念性分类感知，用埃弗雷特的话说，“因为刺激物落入了不同的概念类别，人们能更清楚地区分刺激物”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        How much these fascinatingly different conceptions matter in everyday
        life is a “thornier issue,” Everett admits. Some would argue that the
        effects of linguistic differences are relatively slight, appearing
        mainly under carefully calibrated experimental conditions. No one would
        dispute that different lexicons on some level reflect the different
        priorities, lifeways, and environments of speakers; indeed, there are
        more words for snow in languages spoken where snow exists. But
        relatively few of the presumably “deeper” grammatical differences are
        readily explained by social, cultural, or environmental variables.
        Certain ones clearly are—including levels of politeness in more
        stratified societies and directional markers based on local
        topography—but the fact that English speakers pluralize nouns and
        Mandarin speakers do not has to be seen as an arbitrary detail of
        linguistic history without any nonlinguistic consequences. Sometimes,
        the differences between languages are merely that, with many linguistic
        features essentially random parameters that have no deeper cultural or
        cognitive meaning. Not only is there currently no basis for seeing it
        otherwise, but the resulting pseudoscientific generalizations could be
        downright dangerous. Imagine if people started believing that Hopi
        speakers had no sense of time, whereas Yagua speakers had the most
        sophisticated understanding of it, and English speakers were somewhere
        in the middle. Actual linguistic practices are simply too dynamic,
        situational, and mixed to generalize about in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        这些千差万别的观念在日常生活中有多重要，埃弗雷特承认，这是个“棘手的问题”。有人会说，语言差异的影响相对较小，主要出现在经过精心校准的实验环境中。没人会否认，不同的词汇表在某种程度上反映了说话者的不同优先事项、生活方式和环境；确实，生活在多雪地区的语言中关于雪的词汇更多。但相对较少的、所谓的“深层”语法差异很难用社会、文化和环境变量来解释。有些显然可以解释，包括在更分层的社会中的礼貌程度，以及基于当地地形的方向标记——但英语使用者将名词复数化，而普通话使用者不这样做，这必须被视为语言历史上的一个任意细节，没有任何非语言后果。有时候，语言之间的差异仅此而已，许多语言特征基本上是随机参数，没有更深层次的文化或认知意义。目前不仅没有理由认为情况不是这样，而且由此产生的伪科学一般化可能非常危险。想象一下，如果人们开始相信霍皮语使用者没有时间感，而雅瓜语使用者对时间的理解最为深刻，而英语使用者则介于两者之间。实际的语言实践太过动态、情境化和混合，无法以这种方式进行概括。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, A Myriad of Tongues gently suggests that certain
        connections between language, culture, and thought can be found. Farmers
        with softer diets—and thus a tendency for their top teeth to protrude in
        overbites and overjets—may be more likely to use labiodental sounds,
        such as f and v, that combine the top front teeth and the bottom lip,
        whereas hunter-gatherers, with their edge-to-edge bites, in which the
        top and bottom front teeth are flush, use these sounds less. Although
        the use of commercial dyes in WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized,
        rich, and democratic) societies has recently enriched the color terms in
        those languages, hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies may have led to
        richer “olfactory lexicons” in others—such as the 15 abstract terms for
        different smells documented for the Chapalaa language of Ecuador.
      </p>
      <p>
        然而，《万语千言》还是温和地提出，语言、文化和思维之间可能存在某些联系。饮食较软的农民（因此他们的上门牙更有可能突出，形成龅牙）可能更倾向于使用唇齿音，比如f和v，这类发音需要用到上前牙和下唇，而以狩猎采集为生的人上门牙和下门牙齐平（牙齿呈剪刀状咬合），使用这类发音的可能性较小。虽然在西方发达工业化的富裕民主社会（WEIRD）中，商业染料的使用最近丰富了这些语言中的颜色词汇，但狩猎采集的生活方式可能让其他语言拥有了更丰富的“嗅觉词汇”，例如厄瓜多尔查帕拉语就有15个表示不同气味的抽象词。

        Fascinating as they may be for linguists and cognitive scientists,
        languages such as Aymara, Berinmo, and Chapalaa are not just bundles of
        exotic features waiting to be displayed in some future museum of the
        world’s languages, or at least in one of the new digital archives where
        linguists are depositing recordings of them. Like all languages, they
        are to varying degrees emblems and embodiments of group belonging, in
        which every feature, however arbitrary, may be laden with political
        meaning. Yet in their particular circumstances, these languages face
        different challenges: the pressures on Berinmo, which has a few hundred
        speakers in two villages, will not be the same as those on Chapalaa,
        which has several thousand speakers in a rainforest territory, or
        Aymara, which has around three million speakers spread across multiple
        countries.

        尽管这些语言可能对语言学家和认知科学家很有吸引力，但艾马拉语、贝尔诺莫语或查帕拉语并非只是等待着未来某个世界语言博物馆(或者至少是那些语言学家正在往里上传录音的新开设的数字档案馆)展出的异域特色集合。和其他所有语言一样，在不同程度上，它们都是群体归属感的象征和体现，其中每一种特征，无论多么任意，都可能带有政治含义。然而，具体到每一种语言，它们又面临着不同的挑战：拥有两村几百名使用者的贝尔诺莫语所承受的压力，与拥有丛林领地几千名使用者的查帕拉语，以及横跨多个国家、约有三百万使用者的艾马拉语所承受的压力，肯定不一样。

        A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot—“A language is a dialect
        with an army and a navy”—in the famous Yiddish phrase uttered in the
        1940s by an unknown Bronx high school teacher to the linguist Max
        Weinreich. More than the linguistic criterion of mutual intelligibility,
        this sly witticism puts its finger on how some “language varieties” (to
        use a more neutral term preferred by linguists over “language” or
        “dialect”) are elevated and developed above others. According to
        Weinreich, the teacher had never heard that his own mother tongue had a
        history and “could be used for higher matters” beyond just the basics of
        everyday life and oral communication.

        “语言就是有军队和海军的方言”——这是20世纪40年代，一位布朗克斯高中老师对语言学家马克·维恩赖希(Max
        Weinreich)说的一句著名的意第绪语俏皮话。这句机智的俏皮话比语言学上的互译性标准更准确地揭示了，为何有些“语言变体”(这是语言学家相对于“语言”或“方言”更喜欢使用的中性术语)的地位高于其他变体，并得到发展。据维恩赖希说，这位老师从没听说过，自己的母语还有历史，“能用于更重要的事情”，而不仅仅局限于日常生活和口头交流的基本需求。

        Now more than ever, global inequalities are producing linguistic ones.
        Speakers of endangered languages are ever more marginalized as their
        lands are taken or made uninhabitable by climate change; they enter both
        cities and the cash economy at the bottom of the hierarchy. The few
        hundred languages that enjoy official status and some form of
        governmental support are pulling away from all the others with the
        spread of mass literacy, standardization, formal education, mass media,
        and new technologies. One study found that less than five percent of all
        languages are “ascending” into the digital realm, flourishing online and
        in a range of new technologies. As for the other 95 percent of human
        languages, although every bit as sophisticated on a grammatical and
        cognitive level, they may have to be supported if they are going to
        survive. To assert that a language has not just a history but also a
        future requires, in most cases, the mobilizing of people, resources, and
        social pressure: a language movement.

        语言上的不平等如今正在加剧全球不平等。随着气候变化让很多人的家园变得不宜居住，说濒危语言的人越来越边缘化，他们无论是在城市还是在货币经济中都处于社会底层。几百种得到官方承认并受到某种形式政府支持的语言与所有其他语言之间的差距正在加大，因为识字率提高、标准化普及、正规教育推广、大众媒体发展以及新技术的应用都在推波助澜。一项研究发现，只有不到5%的语言“进入”了数字领域，在网上和各种新技术中欣欣向荣。而其余95%的人类语言——尽管在语法和认知层面同样复杂——如果要生存下去，可能都需要获得支持。在大多数情况下，要断言一种语言不仅有历史还有未来，就需要调动人力、资源和社会压力：一场语言运动。

        The groundbreaking language movements of the twentieth century have
        shown that any language can be made modern, even as dominant languages
        extend their sway over the world—and even in the absence of an army and
        a navy. A few generations ago, it seemed that the Welsh language was
        locked in inevitable decline with fewer and fewer young people able to
        speak it. But thanks to the work of activists—and the eventual support
        of local, national, and even continental governments such as the
        European Union—the language has been revived to the point that even in
        the heartland of English, it has a stable population of speakers and is
        thriving. The twentieth-century language movements of the Basques and
        Catalans benefited from the economic wealth and autonomy of those
        regions of Spain. Advocates of Maori in New Zealand and of Hawaiian have
        emphasized the importance of inculcating these languages in early
        childhood development and education as part of their successful revival.
        The extraordinary efforts of many Native American revitalization
        programs are demonstrating that even smaller groups may be able to carve
        out a place for languages that have been “asleep,” as linguists describe
        languages with no fluent speakers, for a century or more.

        20世纪的语言运动已经证明，任何语言都可以现代化，哪怕强势语言正在全球范围内扩大影响力，哪怕没有军队和海军。就在几代人之前，威尔士语似乎注定要走向衰落，越来越少的年轻人会说这种语言。但多亏了活动人士的努力——以及最终来自地方、国家乃至欧洲联盟等超国家政府的支持——威尔士语得以复兴，现在即使在英格兰的核心地区，也有一群稳定的人口在使用这种语言，并且它正在蓬勃发展。巴斯克人和加泰罗尼亚人在20世纪的语言运动得益于西班牙这些地区的经济繁荣和自治。新西兰的毛利人和夏威夷的倡导者强调，在早期儿童发展和教育中灌输这些语言对于它们的成功复兴至关重要。许多美洲原住民复兴计划的非凡努力表明，即使是人数较少的群体也可能为那些已“沉睡”了一个多世纪的语言——语言学家如此描述那些没有流利使用者的语言——找到一席之地。

        The political theorist Will Kymlicka has written that “national
        minorities should have the same tools of nation-building available to
        them as the majority nation,” and perhaps many countries will see fit to
        offer linguistic and cultural autonomy to minorities as long as ultimate
        authority remains in the capital. But how far can that process go? The
        linguist Gerald Roche points out that language movements “often take
        nationalist form, reproducing the logic of one people, one language, one
        territory, endeavoring to capture or create state power for their
        nation, and oppressing the languages of second-order minorities in the
        process.” An example Roche points to is the Tibetan independence
        struggle, which has given rise to a “pure father-tongue movement” that
        tends to focus on Standard Tibetan and ignore Tibet’s many other
        languages and dialects.

        政治理论家威尔·基姆利卡(Will
        Kymlicka)曾写道，“少数民族应该拥有与多数民族一样的国家建设工具”，也许许多国家会认为，只要最终权力仍在首都，就应该向少数民族提供语言和文化上的自治。但这个过程能走多远呢?语言学家杰拉尔德·罗奇(Gerald
        Roche)指出，语言运动“往往采取民族主义的形式，再现一个民族、一种语言、一种领土的逻辑，努力为自己的民族夺取或创造国家权力，并在此过程中压迫第二少数民族的语言。”罗奇举出的一个例子是西藏独立运动，这场运动引发了一场“纯母语运动”，它往往把重点放在标准藏语上，而忽略了西藏的许多其他语言和方言。

        Language movements are nothing new, but they have formed an integral
        part of most of the political movements that lie behind nearly every
        contemporary nation-state. What is distinctive today is a world order in
        which few new nation-states can emerge but in which language movements
        are rising everywhere in response to the pressures of endangerment,
        through the force of imitation and often under the banner of indigenous
        rights. Many governments are responding to these demands at least with
        symbolic gestures—enshrining languages in constitutions including those
        of Alaska and Algeria, for example, while spending little on resources
        for them—but the demands are likely to keep growing.

        语言运动并非新生事物，但几乎所有现代民族国家背后的政治运动几乎都包含语言运动。
        当前的特殊之处在于：几乎没有新国家可以诞生，但随着语言受到威胁，世界各地的语言运动纷纷兴起，这既是仿效的结果，也常常打着土著权利的旗号。
        许多政府至少以象征性姿态对这些诉求作出回应——比如，阿拉斯加(Alaska)和阿尔及利亚(Algeria)等国在宪法中承认了各地方言，但却很少为这些语言提供资源支持——但相关诉求可能还会继续增多。

        Not every group will resist the passing of its language. Nor will every
        language movement inevitably turn political and spur secession, ethnic
        conflict, and civil war. But from Cameroon to Catalonia, as from Hong
        Kong to Ukraine, language politics are gaining currency more than ever
        before. With decolonization, creole languages from Port Moresby to
        Port-au-Prince are climbing out of the shadows. In Jamaica, the
        political push to exit the British Commonwealth has accompanied a
        linguistic push to elevate Patwa, long stigmatized as a “broken” form of
        English. Nor are new language movements only about these fairly large,
        quasi-national languages often with hundreds of thousands of speakers.
        Hundreds of much smaller groups are collaborating with linguists,
        harnessing new technologies, and drawing inspiration from the pioneering
        twentieth-century movements. It is the dialects with neither armies nor
        navies that need support most of all.

        并非所有社群都会誓死捍卫其语言。也并非所有语言运动注定会变得具有政治色彩，从而导致分裂主义、民族冲突和内战。然而，从喀麦隆到加泰罗尼亚，再到香港和乌克兰，语言政治比以往任何时候都更受重视。随着非殖民化进程的推进，从莫尔斯比港（Port
        Moresby）到太子港（Port-au-Prince），各种克里奥尔语纷纷摆脱阴影，走到台前。在牙买加，退出英联邦的政治努力与提升帕特瓦语（Patwa）地位的语言努力相伴而行。长久以来，帕特瓦语一直被视为“不纯正”的英语形式。新的语言运动也不仅仅关乎这些拥有数十万乃至数百万使用者的较大规模的准民族语言。成百上千个较小的社群正在与语言学家合作，利用新技术，并从20世纪的先驱运动中汲取灵感。最需要支持的，是那些没有军队也没有海军的方言。
