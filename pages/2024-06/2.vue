        To Israelis, October 7, 2023, is the worst day in their country’s
        75-year history. Never before have so many of them been massacred and
        taken hostage on a single day. Thousands of heavily armed Hamas fighters
        managed to break through the Gaza Strip’s fortified border and into
        Israel, rampaging unimpeded for hours, destroying several villages, and
        committing gruesome acts of brutality before Israeli forces could regain
        control. Israelis have compared the attack to the Holocaust; Prime
        Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described Hamas as “the new Nazis.” In
        response, the Israel Defense Forces have pursued an open-ended military
        campaign in Gaza driven by rage and the desire for revenge. Netanyahu
        promises that the IDF will fight Hamas until it achieves “total
        victory,” although even his own military has been hard put to define
        what this means. He has offered no clear idea of what should happen when
        the fighting stops, other than to assert that Israel must maintain
        security control of all of Gaza and the West Bank.

        对大多数以色列人来说，2023年10月7日是这个国家75年历史上最黑暗的一天。在那一天，前所未有的大屠杀和大规模人质劫持事件同时发生。数千名全副武装的哈马斯战士突破了加沙地带的加固边界，进入以色列，在几个小时内畅通无阻地肆虐，摧毁了数个村庄，犯下了可怕的暴行，直到以色列军队重新控制局面才停止。这次袭击让以色列人想起了大屠杀；总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡称哈马斯为“新的纳粹”。作为回应，以色列国防军（IDF）发起了一场由愤怒和复仇欲望驱动的、没有明确终点的军事行动。内塔尼亚胡承诺，以色列国防军将与哈马斯战斗到底，直至取得“彻底胜利”，尽管他自己的军队也很难说清楚这到底意味着什么。除了坚称以色列必须维持对加沙和约旦河西岸的全部安全控制外，他没有提出任何明确的设想来说明战争结束后应该发生什么。

        For Palestinians, the Gaza war is the worst event they have experienced
        in 75 years. Never have so many of them been killed and uprooted since
        the nakba, the catastrophe that befell them during Israel’s war of
        independence in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were
        forced to give up their homes and became refugees. Like the Israelis,
        they also point to terrible acts of violence: by late March, Israel’s
        military campaign had taken the lives of tens of thousands of
        Palestinians, among them thousands of children, and rendered well over a
        million homeless. As the Palestinians see it, the Israeli offensive is
        part of a larger plan to incorporate all Palestinian lands into the
        Jewish state and get them to abandon Gaza entirely—an idea that has in
        fact been raised by some members of Netanyahu’s government. The
        Palestinians also hold on to the illusion of return, the principle that
        they will one day be able to reclaim their historic homes in Israel
        itself—a kind of Palestinian Zionism that, like Israel’s maximalist
        aspirations, can never come true.
      </p>
      <p>
        对巴勒斯坦人来说，加沙战争是他们75年来经历的最糟糕事件。自1948年以色列独立战争期间的灾难(nakba)以来，从没有这么多的巴勒斯坦人被杀害和流离失所，当时数十万巴勒斯坦人流离失所，成为难民。和以色列人一样，他们也指出了可怕的暴力行为：到3月底，以色列的军事行动已造成数万名巴勒斯坦人死亡，其中包括数千名儿童，使100多万人无家可归。在巴勒斯坦人看来，以色列的攻势是更大计划的一部分，即把所有巴勒斯坦土地并入犹太国家，并迫使他们彻底放弃加沙——事实上，内塔尼亚胡政府中的一些成员已经提出过这个想法。巴勒斯坦人还抱着回归的幻想，即有一天他们能够重新回到以色列境内的历史家园——这有点像巴勒斯坦的犹太复国主义，和以色列的扩张野心一样，永远无法实现。

        Ever since the first Zionists began to conceive of a Jewish homeland in
        Palestine in the late nineteenth century, Jewish leaders and their Arab
        counterparts have understood that an all-encompassing settlement between
        them was likely impossible. As early as 1919, David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s
        future first prime minister, recognized that there could be no peace in
        Palestine. Both the Jews and the Arabs, he observed, were claiming the
        land for themselves, and both were doing so as nations. “There is no
        solution to this question,” he repeatedly declared. “There is an abyss
        between us, and nothing can fill that abyss.” The inevitable conflict,
        he concluded, could at best be managed—limited or contained, perhaps,
        but not resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        自从十九世纪末首批犹太复国主义者开始构想在巴勒斯坦建立一个犹太国家以来，犹太领导人及其阿拉伯对手就认识到，他们之间不太可能达成全面的解决方案。早在1919年，以色列未来的首任总理戴维·本-古里安(David
        Ben-Gurion)就意识到，在巴勒斯坦不可能有和平。他指出，犹太人和阿拉伯人都声称这片土地是自己的，而且是以民族的名义这样做的。“这个问题没有解决办法，”他反复说道。“我们之间存在鸿沟，没有什么能够填平它。”他认为，不可避免的冲突至多只能加以管理——也许可以限制或控制，但无法解决。

        In the months since the October 7 attacks, critics of Netanyahu, noting
        his efforts to bolster Hamas and his push for Arab normalization deals
        that sideline the Palestinian issue, have accused him of trying to
        manage the conflict rather than end it. But that complaint misreads
        history. Netanyahu’s cardinal blunder was not his attempt to parry the
        issues that divide Jews and Arabs. It was that he did so more
        incompetently—and with more disastrous consequences—than anyone else
        over the past century. Indeed, conflict management is the only real
        option that either side, and their international interlocutors, has ever
        had. From its beginnings, the conflict has always been perpetuated by
        religion and mythology—violent fundamentalism and messianic prejudices,
        fantasies and symbols, and deep-rooted anxieties—rather than by concrete
        interests and calculated strategies. The irrational nature of the
        conflict has been the main reason why it could never be resolved. Only
        by confronting this enduring reality can world leaders begin to approach
        a crisis that demands not more empty talk of solutions for the future
        but urgent action to better cope with the present.

        自10月7日袭击事件发生以来，内塔尼亚胡的批评者指出，他既在扶植哈马斯，又在推动让巴勒斯坦问题边缘化的阿以和解协议，因此指责他是在维持现状，而不是解决问题。但这种批评误解了历史。内塔尼亚胡的致命错误并非他试图回避导致犹太人和阿拉伯人分裂的问题，而是他在过去一个世纪里比任何人都更无能地、灾难性地这么做了。事实上，冲突管理一直是双方及其国际对话者唯一可行的选择。自诞生之初，这场冲突就一直是由宗教和神话——暴力原教旨主义和救世主式的偏见、幻想和符号，以及根深蒂固的焦虑——而非具体的利益和精心计算的战略所驱动的。冲突的非理性是它无法得到解决的主要原因。只有正视这一持久的现实，世界各国领导人オ可能着手应对这一要求采取紧急行动改善现状、而非空谈未来解决方案的危机。

        Not far from the grave of Theodor Herzl, the father of political
        Zionism, on the mountain in Jerusalem that bears his name, is a national
        memorial to generations of Jewish victims of terrorism. The monument
        reflects an Israeli tendency to try to prove that Jews were persecuted
        by Arabs in Palestine long before the first Zionists set foot there. The
        earliest victim mentioned is a Jew from Lithuania who was killed by an
        Arab in 1851 after a financial dispute, and the eviction of some Arabs,
        related to the rebuilding of a synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem.
        The memorial also mentions several Jewish victims of Arab robberies and
        13 Jews who were killed in British bombing raids on Palestine during
        World War I. Palestinian historiography and commemorative culture rely
        on a similarly tendentious use of history.

        在耶路撒冷的赫茨尔山上，离政治犹太复国主义之父西奥多·赫茨尔的墓地不远处，有一座纪念历代恐怖主义受害者——特别是犹太受害者的国家纪念碑。这座纪念碑反映出以色列试图证明，在第一批犹太复国主义者踏上巴勒斯坦土地之前很久，犹太人就已经受到阿拉伯人的迫害。纪念碑上提到的第一个受害者是一位来自立陶宛的犹太人，他在1851年因一起财务纠纷被一名阿拉伯人杀害，以及与重建耶路撒冷老城一座犹太会堂有关的一些阿拉伯人的流放。纪念碑还提到了一些因阿拉伯强盗活动而遇害的犹太人，以及一战期间英军轰炸巴勒斯坦时遇难的13名犹太人。巴勒斯坦的历史叙述和纪念文化也采用了类似的历史操纵手法。

        At the beginning of the nineteenth century, fewer than 7,000 Jews were
        living in Palestine, making up about 2.5 percent of the population of
        what was then an Ottoman province. Some of their communities had been
        there for many centuries. As more Arabs and Jews migrated there, the
        territory’s population grew, and with it the relative proportion of
        Jews. Most Arabs came from neighboring countries in search of
        employment. Most of the Jews came for religious reasons and as refugees
        from pogroms in Eastern Europe, and they tended to settle in the Old
        City of Jerusalem. These immigrants had no intention of establishing
        Jewish statehood in Palestine. In fact, most Jews at the time did not
        believe in the Zionist ideology, and many of them even opposed secular
        Zionism on religious grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        一九○○年，居住在巴勒斯坦的犹太人不到七千人，占当时这个鄂图曼省份总人口的大约百分之二点五。有些犹太社区已在当地存在了数个世纪。随着更多阿拉伯人和犹太人的迁入，这一地区的人口不断增长，犹太人所占的比例也随之上升。多数阿拉伯人从邻近国家前来寻找工作。多数犹太人出于宗教原因以及躲避东欧反犹太主义屠杀而来，他们大多定居于耶路撒冷老城。这些移民并无在巴勒斯坦建立犹太国家的意图。事实上，当时的大多数犹太人不相信犹太复国主义理念，许多人甚至基于宗教理由反对世俗犹太复国主义。

        By the end of the nineteenth century, there were about half a million
        Arabs in Palestine, whereas the number of Jews, although it had
        increased steadily, was around 50,000, or about one-tenth of the
        population. Nonetheless, Herzl’s international activities, including a
        visit in 1898 to Jerusalem, where he was received by the German Kaiser
        Wilhelm II, began to worry leaders of the Palestinian Arabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        十九世纪末，巴勒斯坦有大约五十万阿拉伯人，而犹太人的数量虽然在稳步增加，也只有五万人左右，约占人口的十分之一。然而，赫茨尔的国际活动，包括他在一八九八年对耶路撒冷的访问（其间他受到了德皇威廉二世的接见），开始让巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的领袖感到担忧。

        The following year, Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi, the mayor of Jerusalem,
        expressed his concerns about the Zionists in a remarkable letter written
        to the chief rabbi of France. “Who could contest the rights of the Jews
        in Palestine?” Khalidi began in polite, even sympathetic, French prose.
        “My God, historically it is your country!” But that history was now deep
        in the past, he continued. “Palestine is an integral part of the Ottoman
        Empire, and more gravely, it is inhabited by others,” Khalidi wrote. The
        world was big enough, with plenty of uninhabited land for Jewish
        independence, he concluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        第二年，耶路撒冷的市长优素福·迪亚·哈利迪给法国首席拉比写了一封非凡的信，表达了他对犹太复国主义者的担忧。“谁能否认犹太人在巴勒斯坦的权利呢？”哈利迪以礼貌、甚至同情的法语写道，“天哪，从历史的角度看，这毕竟是你们的国家！”但他接着说，那段历史已经远去。“巴勒斯坦是奥斯曼帝国不可分割的一部分，更严重的是，这里已经住着其他人了。”他写道。世界如此辽阔，有足够的无人居住的土地可供犹太人建国，他总结道。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        “For God’s sake—let Palestine be left alone!” Herzl, who received the
        letter from the French chief rabbi, assured Khalidi in his reply that
        the Zionists would develop the land for the benefit of all inhabitants,
        including the Arabs. Previously, however, he had written that the
        Zionist project might require the resettlement of poor Palestinians to
        neighboring countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        “天啊，让巴勒斯坦人独自生活吧！”在收到法国首席拉比这封信后，赫茨尔在给哈利迪的回信中保证，犹太复国主义者将为包括阿拉伯人在内的所有居民的利益开发这片土地。然而在此之前，他曾写道，犹太复国主义事业可能需要把贫苦的巴勒斯坦人重新安置到邻近国家。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Around the time of Herzl’s death, in 1904, young Zionists, mostly
        socialists from Eastern Europe, began to come to Palestine. One was
        David Gruen, who later changed his name to David Ben-Gurion. Born in
        Poland, he arrived in 1906 at the age of 20 and joined a Jewish workers’
        group in the Galilee. His first political activity was the promotion of
        “Hebrew labor”—an attempt to require Jewish employers to hire Jews
        rather than Arabs. At the time, the Zionists’ acquisition of land also
        led to the dispossession of some Arab agricultural workers, some of whom
        reacted violently. In the spring of 1909, Ben-Gurion’s settlement was
        attacked, and two of his fellow members were killed, one of them
        apparently in front of Ben-Gurion. The future prime minister of Israel
        concluded that the Jews and the Palestinian Arabs had irreconcilable
        differences; there was no escaping the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        在赫茨尔于1904年去世前后，一些年轻的犹太复国主义者，主要是来自东欧的社会主义者，开始来到巴勒斯坦。其中一人是大卫·格鲁恩（David
        Gruen），后来他改名为大卫·本-古里安（David
        Ben-Gurion）。他在波兰出生，在1906年二十岁时来到巴勒斯坦，并加入加利利的一个犹太工人团体。他的首次政治活动就是推动“希伯来劳动”——试图让犹太雇主雇佣犹太人而非阿拉伯人。当时，犹太人购买土地的行为也导致了一些阿拉伯农业工人的丧失生计，他们中的一些人暴力反抗。1909年春天，本-古里安所在的定居点遭到袭击，两名同伴被杀，据说其中一名是在本-古里安眼前遇害的。以色列未来的总理得出结论认为，阿拉伯人和犹太人之间存在不可调和的分歧；冲突无法避免。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Ben-Gurion’s attitude toward the Arabs was further shaped by two other
        experiences. During World War I, he was expelled from Palestine by the
        Ottoman authorities. On one of his last days in Jerusalem, he ran into a
        young Arab with whom he had studied in Istanbul. When Ben-Gurion
        reported that he was about to be expelled, his acquaintance replied that
        as his dear friend, he was deeply sorry for him, but as an Arab
        nationalist, he was very happy. “That was the first time in my life that
        I heard an honest answer from an Arab intellectual,” Ben-Gurion said.
        “His words burned themselves into my heart, very, very deeply.” Years
        later, Ben-Gurion had a conversation with Musa Alami, a prominent Arab
        Palestinian and politician. Ben-Gurion promised as usual that the
        Zionists would develop Palestine for all its inhabitants. According to
        Ben-Gurion, Alami replied that he would rather leave the land poor and
        desolate for another century, if need be, until the Arabs could develop
        it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        贝京对阿拉伯人的看法还受到另外两个经历的影响。第一次世界大战期间，他被奥斯曼当局逐出巴勒斯坦。在离开耶路撒冷的最后几天，他碰到一个曾与他在伊斯坦布尔求学的年轻阿拉伯人。贝京告诉这个熟人他即将被驱逐，对方回答说，作为他的老朋友，他对此感到非常难过；但作为阿拉伯民族主义者，他非常高兴。“那是我生平第一次从一个阿拉伯知识分子那里听到诚实的回答，”贝京后来回忆说，“他的话深深地烙印在我的心中。”多年以后，贝京与著名的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯政治家穆萨·阿勒米进行了一次谈话。贝京照例承诺，犹太复国主义者将为所有巴勒斯坦居民发展这片土地。据贝京说，阿勒米回答说，他宁愿这块土地再贫瘠荒凉一百年，如果必须的话，直到阿拉伯人自己来开发它。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Ben-Gurion often dismissed the “easy solutions” that he attributed to
        some of his colleagues, such as the notion that Jews could be encouraged
        to learn Arabic or even that Jews and Arabs could live together in one
        state. They were refusing to acknowledge the facts. Ben-Gurion’s own
        concept of the Jewish future in Palestine was based simply on acquiring
        as much land as possible, if not necessarily the entire territory, and
        populating it with as many Jews and as few Arabs as possible. His views
        about the conflict remained unchanged to the end of his life and
        continuously informed his efforts to manage it.
      </p>
      <p>
        本-古里安经常嘲笑一些同事提出的“简单解决办法”，比如鼓励犹太人学习阿拉伯语，甚至让犹太人和阿拉伯人在一个国家里和平共处。这些人拒绝正视现实。本-古里安对犹太人在巴勒斯坦前途的设想则简单得多：尽可能多地获取土地——不一定包括全部领土——然后尽可能多的让犹太人、尽可能少的让阿拉伯人生活在这些土地上。他对这场冲突的看法至死未变，并一直指导着他处理这一问题的努力。

        In 1917, the Zionist movement achieved one of its most important
        successes when British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour declared the
        United Kingdom to be in favor of establishing a “national home” for the
        Jewish people in Palestine. The Balfour Declaration, as it became known,
        was part of a strategic British plan to take the Holy Land from Ottoman
        dominion. In reality, like almost everything to do with that land,
        Balfour’s policy was driven more by sentimental religious ideas than by
        rational statecraft. A staunch Christian Zionist, Balfour was committed
        to the idea that the people of God should return to their homeland after
        a 2,000-year exile so that they could fulfill their biblical destiny. He
        aspired to go down in history as the man who made this messianic
        transformation possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        1917年，犹太复国主义迎来了其最重要的胜利之一：英国外交大臣阿瑟·贝尔福(Arthur
        Balfour)宣布，英国政府支持在巴勒斯坦为犹太民族建立“民族家园”。这一声明后来被称为贝尔福宣言(Balfour
        Declaration)，它是英国从奥斯曼帝国手中夺取圣地的战略计划的一部分。实际上，和那个地区几乎所有的事情一样，贝尔福的政策更多的是受到感性的宗教观念而非理性的国家利益考量的驱动。作为一名坚定的基督教锡安主义者，贝尔福坚信上帝的子民应该在两千年的流亡之后重返家园，以便实现其圣经中的命运。他渴望成为实现这一救世转变的人，而被后人铭记。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        As was often the case with Western officials at the time, Balfour’s
        apparent reverence for the Jews simultaneously drew on deep anti-Semitic
        prejudice. Like others of his era, he attributed almost unlimited power
        and influence to “the Jew,” including an ability to determine history
        and even convince the United States to enter World War I. (It was hoped
        that the Balfour Declaration would sway American Jews to push the United
        States to join the Allied powers in the war.)
      </p>
      <p>
        与当时许多西方政要一样，鲍尔弗对犹太人的明显尊崇植根于深厚的反犹主义偏见。与他同时代的许多人一样，他将几乎无限的权力和影响力归于“犹太人”，包括塑造历史的能力，甚至说服美国参加第一次世界大战（人们希望《贝尔福宣言》能说服美国犹太人推动美国加入协约国作战）。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        By the end of 1917, the United Kingdom had conquered Palestine, thus
        beginning nearly 30 years of British rule. During this period, the
        Zionist movement laid the political, economic, cultural, and military
        foundations for the future state of Israel. Tensions with the Arabs
        increased over the years as hundreds of thousands of new Jewish
        immigrants, mainly from Europe, continued to arrive. In the 1920s, these
        immigrants were motivated not by support for Zionism but by the severe
        new immigration restrictions imposed by the United States. In the 1930s,
        more than 50,000 Jewish refugees arrived in Palestine from Nazi Germany,
        although in less desperate circumstances most of them would have
        preferred to stay in their country. 
      </p>
      <p>
        到1917年底，英国占领了巴勒斯坦，开始了将近30年的统治。在此期间，犹太复国主义运动为未来以色列国家的政治、经济、文化和军事奠定了基础。随着数十万新犹太移民，尤其是来自欧洲的移民不断涌入，与阿拉伯人的紧张关系逐渐升级。在20世纪20年代，这些移民来到这里并非出于对犹太复国主义的支持，而是因为美国实行了严厉的新移民限制。在1930年代，有超过5万名来自纳粹德国的犹太难民抵达巴勒斯坦；如果不是在如此绝望的情况下，他们中的大多数本会更愿意留在自己的国家。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Large-scale immigration of Jews sparked more waves of Arab violence
        against Jews and against the British authorities, who were seen as
        supporting Zionist aims. This came to a head in the Arab revolt of
        1936–39, in which Palestinians rose up against the British colonial
        administration through a general strike, an armed insurrection, and
        attacks on railways and Jewish settlements. Amid this turmoil, the
        British began to regard Palestine as a nuisance. To get rid of the
        problem, they appointed the so-called Peel Commission, which recommended
        dividing the land into Jewish and Arab states—the very first “two-state”
        solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        大规模的犹太移民引发了更多针对犹太人和英国当局的阿拉伯暴力事件，英国被看作是支持犹太复国主义者的。这最终导致了1936-1939年的阿拉伯大起义，巴勒斯坦人通过总罢工、武装叛乱和袭击铁路与犹太定居点，起来反抗英国殖民统治。在这样的动荡中，英国开始认为巴勒斯坦是个麻烦。为了解决这个问题，他们任命了所谓的皮尔委员会，该委员会建议将这片土地一分为二，建立一个犹太国家和一个阿拉伯国家——这是最早的“两国方案”。

        Although the Jewish state it envisioned was small, amounting to just 17
        percent of British Mandate Palestine, Ben-Gurion supported the plan.
        Notably, Arab inhabitants of the area designated for the Jewish state
        were to be transferred to the Arab state, a provision that he described
        in his diary as a “forced transfer,” drawing a thick line under the
        words. Most of his colleagues, however, wanted much more land for the
        Jewish state, setting off a contentious debate between the center-left
        Zionist leadership and right-wing “Revisionists” who cultivated a dream
        of a Greater Israel on both banks of the Jordan River. Although they
        stood to gain control of about 75 percent of the land, the Arabs
        rejected the idea of a Jewish state in principle, and the British
        withdrew the plan. Here, again, was the “abyss” between Jews and Arabs
        that Ben-Gurion had identified years earlier and that would become even
        deeper after the Holocaust and the war of 1948.

        尽管所设想的犹太国仅占英国托管巴勒斯坦领土的17%，本-古里安还是支持这一方案。值得注意的是，他日记中提到，根据该方案，犹太国境内的阿拉伯人应被转移至阿拉伯国家，他在相关表述下画了着重线。然而，他的大多数同僚希望犹太国能够获得更多的土地，这引发了以色列左翼领导层与右翼“修正主义者”之间激烈的辩论。后者梦想建立一个横跨约旦河两岸的大以色列。虽然阿拉伯人有望控制约75%的土地，但他们原则上反对建立犹太国家，于是英国撤回了该方案。这里再次出现了本-古里安多年前就已指出的“鸿沟”，后来随着大屠杀和1948年战争的爆发，这个鸿沟变得更深。

        In January 1942, a few weeks before Nazi leaders met at the infamous
        Wannsee Conference to discuss the “Final Solution to the Jewish
        Question,” Foreign Affairs published an article by the Zionist leader
        Chaim Weizmann calling for the establishment of a Jewish state in
        Palestine. At the time, no one outside Germany knew about the Nazis’
        planned extermination camps, but their treatment of Jews in occupied
        Western Europe and during Germany’s ruthless assault on the Soviet Union
        had already made clear that the Nazis were threatening the existence of
        the entire Jewish people. Only total victory over the Third Reich could
        halt the extermination of the Jews, and although Weizmann expressed a
        hope that a better world could be built after the war, his article was
        an urgent appeal for a Jewish homeland. Palestine, he wrote, was the
        only place where Jews, particularly Jewish refugees, could survive.

        1942年1月，纳粹领导人在臭名昭著的万湖会议上讨论“犹太人问题的最终解决方案”前几周，《外交事务》杂志刊发了锡安主义领袖哈伊姆·魏茨曼的文章，呼吁在巴勒斯坦建立一个犹太国家。当时，除了德国人之外，外界无人知晓纳粹计划修建灭绝营。但纳粹对西欧占领区和在无情侵苏期间对犹太人的对待已经清楚地表明，纳粹正威胁着整个犹太民族的生存。只有彻底击败第三帝国，才能阻止对犹太人的灭绝。尽管魏茨曼表示希望战后能建设一个更美好的世界，但他的文章却是一个紧迫的呼吁，要求建立一个犹太人家园。他写道，巴勒斯坦是犹太人，尤其是犹太难民，得以存活的唯一之地。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        From a Zionist perspective, Weizmann’s proposal contained elements of
        compromise: more than 20 years earlier, at the Versailles peace
        conference after World War I, he had presented a map of the Land of
        Israel with biblical borders that extended to the east bank of the
        Jordan River—territory much larger than the country would ever attain.
        In his article, by contrast, Weizmann did not specify borders but
        proposed unlimited Jewish immigration to a democratic country that would
        offer equal rights to all its inhabitants, including Arabs. Although he
        wrote that the Arabs must be “clearly told that the Jews will be
        encouraged to settle in Palestine, and will control their own
        immigration,” he asserted that Arabs would not be discriminated against
        and would “enjoy full autonomy in their own internal affairs.” He also
        did not rule out the possibility that the new Jewish state could join
        “in federation” with neighboring Arab states. But like Ben-Gurion, he
        also foresaw the need to contain the Palestinian Arabs: should they
        wish, he wrote, “every facility will be given to them to transfer to one
        of the many and vast Arab countries.”
      </p>
      <p>
        在志士眼中，魏茨曼的方案包含着妥协因素：早在20多年前的第一次世界大战后的凡尔赛和平会议上，他所展示的以色列版图是依据圣经界限，一直延伸到约旦河东岸——远大于这个国家后来的实际疆域。而在他的文章中，魏茨曼并没有明确边界，而是提议允许无限额的犹太移民进入一个民主国家，该国将给予所有居民（包括阿拉伯人）平等权利。虽然他写道，必须“清楚地告诉阿拉伯人，犹太人会受到鼓励定居巴勒斯坦，并控制自己的移民”，但他也宣称，不会歧视阿拉伯人，他们“在内部事务上享有完全自治”。他也没有排除新犹太国可能与周边阿拉伯国家“联邦”的可能性。但和本-古里安一样，他也预见到需要限制巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人：如果他们愿意的话，他写道，应该“提供一切便利，让他们迁移到众多广阔的阿拉伯国家中去”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Attempting to convince his readers that the Jews were worthy of help,
        Weizmann somewhat pathetically promised that “the Jew” no longer fit the
        anti-Semitic stereotypes that were prevalent in the West before the
        start of the Zionist project. “When the Jew is reunited with the soil of
        Palestine,” he wrote, “energies are released” that if “given an outlet,
        can create values which may be of service even to richer and more
        fortunate countries.” Weizmann compared the hoped-for Zionist state to
        Switzerland, “another small country, also poor in natural resources,”
        that had nevertheless become “one of the most orderly and stable of
        European democracies.” Seven years later, he was elected the first
        president of Israel. In the meantime, the Nazis had murdered six million
        Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
        为了说服读者，犹太人值得同情，魏茨曼有点可怜兮兮地保证说，“犹太人”已经不再符合在犹太复国主义计划开始之前西方流行的反犹刻板印象。“当犹太人与巴勒斯坦的土地重逢时，”他写道，“被释放出的能量”如果“有适当的出路”，就能创造出甚至对更富裕、更幸运的国家也有用的价值。”他把期望中的犹太国家比作瑞士，“另一个自然资源匮乏的小国”，却“成了欧洲最有序、最稳定的民主国家之一”。七年后，他当选为以色列第一任总统。与此同时，纳粹屠杀了六百万犹太人。

        In November 1947, the UN General Assembly recommended the partition of
        Palestine, this time in a division that would give each side broadly
        equitable areas of land, with the Old City of Jerusalem under
        international control. The Arabs rejected the plan, in accordance with
        their traditional objection to Jewish statehood in Palestine. The
        Zionists accepted partition, although Ben-Gurion expected war and hoped
        that it would end with territory that was empty of Arabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        1947年11月，联合国大会通过决议，建议在巴勒斯坦分治，犹太人和阿拉伯人各自拥有大致公平的领土，而耶路撒冷老城则置于国际控制之下。阿拉伯人按照惯例，因为反对巴勒斯坦境内的犹太国家而拒绝了这一计划。犹太复国主义者接受了分治，尽管本-古里安预料会有一场战争，并希望战争最后能为犹太人带来没有阿拉伯人的土地。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Soon afterward, Arab militias began a series of attacks on the Jewish
        population, and Zionist groups retaliated with actions against Arab
        communities. In May 1948, Ben-Gurion declared Israel’s independence. It
        was a dangerous gamble. Regular Arab armies and volunteers from Egypt,
        Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Transjordan were about to invade
        the new country, and top commanders of the Jewish armed forces warned
        that the odds of defeating them were even at best. U.S. Secretary of
        State George Marshall demanded an immediate cease-fire; Ben-Gurion
        feared that the Zionists were not ready for war. Before the UN partition
        plan was announced, he had tried in vain to persuade the British to stay
        in Palestine for five to ten more years, which could have given the Jews
        more time to increase immigration and strengthen their forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        此后不久，阿拉伯民兵开始对犹太人发动一系列袭击，而犹太复国主义团体则以针对阿拉伯社区的报复行动作为回应。1948年5月，本-古里安宣布以色列独立。这是一个危险的赌注：正规的阿拉伯军队和来自埃及、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和外约旦的志愿者即将入侵这个新国家，而犹太武装部队的高级指挥官警告说，即使能够打败他们，机会也很渺茫。美国国务卿乔治·马歇尔要求立即停火；本-古里安担心犹太复国主义者还没有准备好打仗。在联合国分治计划公布之前，他曾试图说服英国人在巴勒斯坦再留五到十年，这本来可以给犹太人更多时间来增加移民和增强军力。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        But faced with the historic opportunity to declare a Jewish state,
        Ben-Gurion chose to obey a Zionist imperative that he said had guided
        him since the age of three. He later explained that the Israelis won not
        because they were better at fighting but because the Arabs were even
        worse. In keeping with his abiding view that establishing a Jewish
        majority was more important than gaining territory, he led the army to
        push out or expel most of the Arabs—some 750,000—who fled to the West
        Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, which Ben-Gurion left unoccupied, as
        well as to neighboring Arab countries. A direct line could be traced
        from the Zionists’ campaign in the 1920s to replace Arab workers with
        Jews to the far larger effort in 1948 to remove Arabs from the land of
        the new Jewish state. Israel lost close to 6,000 soldiers in that war,
        nearly one percent of the new country’s Jewish population at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        但面对建立一个犹太国家的历史性机遇，本-古里安选择遵循他自认从三岁起就秉持的犹太复国主义信条。后来，他解释说，以色列之所以获胜，并非因为其战斗力更强，而是因为阿拉伯人更差劲。按照他一贯坚持的观念——建立犹太人口多数比获取领土更重要——本-古里安指挥军队将大部分（约75万）逃到西岸、东耶路撒冷和加沙（本-古里安没有占领那里）以及邻近阿拉伯国家的阿拉伯人赶了出去。从1920年代犹太复国主义者为用犹太工人取代阿拉伯工人所作的努力，到1948年为从新犹太国家的土地上清除阿拉伯人所作的更大规模努力，其间存在一条直接的线索。那场战争中，以色列损失了近6000名士兵，几乎占当时犹太人口的1%。

        When the war ended in early 1949, green pencils were used to draw
        armistice boundaries between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the famous
        “Green Line.” Gaza became an Egyptian protectorate, and the West Bank
        was annexed by Jordan. Israel now controlled more territory than it had
        been allocated in the UN partition plan. It was also almost free of
        Arabs; the ones who remained were subjected to a rather arbitrary and
        often corrupt military rule. Most Israelis at the time saw this as an
        acceptable situation—a rational way of managing the conflict. The Arabs
        in turn considered Israel’s existence a humiliation that had to be
        remedied. In Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, authorities did not allow
        Palestinian refugees to be integrated into their new countries of
        residence, forcing them instead to live in temporary camps, where they
        were encouraged to nurture the idea of return.
      </p>
      <p>
        1949年初战争结束时，绿色铅笔被用来在以色列和其阿拉伯邻国之间划出停火线，即著名的“绿线”。加沙成为埃及的保护地，而约旦则吞并了西岸。此时，以色列控制的领土比联合国分治决议分配给它的还要多。而且，它几乎已经没有阿拉伯人；留下来的阿拉伯人则受到一种相当武断且常常腐败的军事管制。当时大多数以色列人认为这是一个可以接受的局面——管理冲突的理性方式。而阿拉伯人则认为以色列的存在是一种必须消除的耻辱。在约旦、黎巴嫩和叙利亚，当局不允许巴勒斯坦难民融入他们现在居住的国家，而是把他们安置在临时难民营，鼓励他们抱持回归故土的想法。

        In the first two decades after independence, Israel made remarkable
        achievements. But it failed to reach the Zionist goal of providing the
        entire Jewish people with a safe national homeland. Most of the world’s
        Jews, including many survivors of the Holocaust, still preferred to
        remain in other countries; those in the Soviet Union and other communist
        countries were forbidden to emigrate by the authorities in those places.
        After the 1948 war, most Middle Eastern Jews, many of whose families had
        been in the region for thousands of years, no longer felt safe in Muslim
        countries and chose—or were forced—to leave. Most settled in Israel, at
        first often as destitute refugees. By the mid-1960s, immigrants who had
        arrived since independence made up around 60 percent of the Israeli
        population. Most had not yet mastered the Hebrew language, and they
        often disagreed on basic values and even on how to define a Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
        建国后的最初二十年里，以色列取得了显著的成就。但它未能实现为全体犹太人提供一个安全的民族家园这一锡安主义目标。多数世界上的犹太人，包括许多大屠杀幸存者，依然选择留在其他国家；而苏联和其他共产国家的犹太人则被当局禁止移居国外。1948年战争之后，许多在该地区居住了数个世纪之久的中东犹太人不再觉得穆斯林国家是安全的，他们选择了（或被迫）离开。大多数人在以色列定居，起初往往是作为贫困的难民。到六十年代中期，自建国以来的移民占到了以色列人口的大约60%。他们大多尚未掌握希伯来语，而且往往在基本价值观上意见相左，甚至对如何定义犹太人也有争议。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Ben-Gurion continued to manage the conflict, but many Israelis,
        particularly newcomers, felt that Israel’s existence was still in
        danger. Only a few close confidants knew about Ben-Gurion’s nuclear
        project. Border wars frequently broke out; the IDF prepared contingency
        plans for the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. During the Suez
        crisis of 1956, Israeli forces invaded Egypt, occupying Gaza and the
        Sinai Peninsula, but withdrew a few months later. In a cabinet meeting,
        Ben-Gurion said that if he believed in miracles, he would ask for Gaza
        to be swallowed up by the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        贝京继续处理这些冲突，但许多以色列人，尤其是新移民，仍觉得以色列的生存受到威胁。只有少数几个密友知道贝京的核计划。边境战争时有爆发；以色列国防军制定了占领西岸和加沙的应急计划。在1956年的苏伊士危机中，以色列军队入侵埃及，占领了加沙和西奈半岛，但几个月后又撤离了。在一次内阁会议上，贝京说，如果他相信奇迹，他会祈求大海将加沙吞噬。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        After Ben-Gurion resigned in 1963, Israelis were left with a weak and
        hesitant leadership and a deep economic crisis. More and more of them
        began to lose confidence in Israel’s future. In 1966, the number of Jews
        emigrating from the country exceeded the number entering it. A popular
        joke referred to a sign supposedly hanging at the exit gate of the
        international airport that read: “Would the last person to leave the
        country please turn off the lights?”
      </p>
      <p>
        1963年本-古里安辞职后，以色列人不得不面对软弱犹豫的领导层和严重的经济危机，他们对国家未来的信心开始流失。1966年，离开以色列的犹太人数超过了进入以色列的犹太人数。有个流行的笑话提到，据说在国际机场的大门上挂着一个告示：“请最后离开这个国家的人关掉电灯。”

      <h3>LAND FOR WAR</h3>
      <h3>为战争提供土地</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        By the mid-1960s, a new generation of Palestinian refugees had grown up
        on the legacy of the nakba and the dream of return. They founded the
        Palestine Liberation Organization, a movement that declared a war to
        free Palestinians and establish an Arab state encompassing their entire
        historical land, and began carrying out attacks on military and civilian
        targets in Israel. Some Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel from
        Syria and Jordan. Israel responded with military reprisals, and in May
        1967, Egyptian officials openly threatened to “annihilate” Israel. As
        tensions rose, many Israelis doubted that their country could survive,
        and the weariest ones relived their Holocaust experiences. Playgrounds
        around the country were hastily prepared to serve as burial grounds for
        the tens of thousands of the expected dead. Israel’s decision to attack
        Egypt in June 1967 was not only a preemptive strike but also an act of
        nightmarish panic.
      </p>
      <p>
        到20世纪60年代中期，新的一代巴勒斯坦难民已在大灾难的遗产和回归的梦想中长大。他们成立了巴勒斯坦解放组织(PLO)，这个运动宣布对解放巴勒斯坦和建立一个涵盖他们全部历史土地的阿拉伯国家的战争，并开始袭击以色列境内的军事和民用目标。一些巴勒斯坦战士从叙利亚和约旦渗透到以色列境内。以色列以军事报复作为回应，而1967年5月，埃及官员公开威胁要“消灭”以色列。随着紧张局势升级，许多以色列人怀疑自己的国家能否存活下来，最悲观的人重温了他们的大屠杀经历。全国各地的操场被匆忙改造为预计数万死者之墓地。以色列在1967年6月决定进攻埃及，这不仅是先发制人的打击，也是一场噩梦般的恐慌之举。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        But the surprise attack, launching what would come to be called the
        Six-Day War, resulted in a dramatic victory for the IDF. Within hours,
        the Egyptian air force had been destroyed on the ground, and Israelis’
        existential dread was replaced by an almost uncontrolled triumphalism.
        Led by Revisionist opposition leader Menachem Begin, who had joined
        Israel’s emergency cabinet on the eve of the war and would later become
        prime minister, as well as some other cabinet ministers, prominent
        Israeli politicians demanded the “liberation” of what they called
        Greater Israel—the biblical land that included the entire West Bank and
        East Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        但闪电战以及随后的六日战争却以以色列国防军戏剧性的胜利而告终。在几个小时之内，埃及空军就被摧毁于地面，而以色列人曾经的生存恐惧则被近乎失控的沙文主义所取代。在战争爆发前夕加入紧急内阁（后来成为总理）的修正主义反对派领导人梅纳赫姆·贝京（Menachem
        Begin）以及一些其他内阁部长带头呼吁“解放”他们所谓的“大以色列”——包括整个西岸和东耶路撒冷在内的圣经故土。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Such an ambition reflected national and religious feelings, but
        strategically it was contested. A few months before the war, senior
        officials from the IDF, the prime minister’s office, and the Mossad, the
        Israeli intelligence agency, had met to discuss the possibility that
        King Hussein of Jordan would be overthrown by Palestinians living in the
        West Bank. At the time, the Israeli leadership concluded that the king
        was working to eradicate Palestinian nationalism in Jordan and the West
        Bank and that it would be advisable, indeed almost vital, for Israel to
        stay out of it. After the June victory, however, none of the cabinet
        ministers questioned why it would be in Israel’s interest to occupy land
        that was populated by millions of Palestinians. Having just experienced
        a kind of national resurrection, they were determined to acquire as much
        land as possible. The impulse came from the heart, not from the head.
      </p>
      <p>
        这一目标反映了民族和宗教情感，但从战略角度来说是有争议的。就在战争爆发前几个月，以色列国防军(IDF)、总理办公室和情报机构摩萨德(Mossad)的高级官员开会讨论了约旦国王侯赛因(King
        Hussein)可能被西岸的巴勒斯坦人推翻的可能性。当时，以色列领导人认为，国王正在努力消除约旦和西岸的巴勒斯坦民族主义，因此以色列最好置身事外，实际上这是至关重要的。然而，在6月取得胜利后，没有一位内阁部长质疑，占领数百万巴勒斯坦人居住的土地对以色列有什么好处。在刚刚经历了一种民族复兴之后，他们决心尽可能多地获取土地。这种冲动发自内心，而非出自理智。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Ben-Gurion had opposed the attack on Egypt because he feared defeat,
        including the destruction of Israel’s nuclear reactor in Dimona. After
        the war, he said that if he had to choose between a smaller state of
        Israel with peace or the newly expanded boundaries without peace, he
        would choose the first option. But even he could not contain his
        emotions when Israeli forces entered the Arab-controlled areas of
        Jerusalem at the beginning of the war. Shortly afterward, he demanded
        that the wall of the Old City immediately be torn down to ensure that
        Jerusalem remained “united” forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        本-古里安曾反对进攻埃及，因为他害怕失败，包括担心戴蒙亚（Dimona）的以色列核反应堆会遭到摧毁。战后他表示，如果要在和平的狭小以色列和没有和平的更大版图之间做选择，他会倾向于前者。但在战争初期，当以色列军队进入东耶路撒冷的阿拉伯控制区时，他也没能抑制住自己的情绪。随后不久，他就要求立即推倒旧城城墙，以确保耶路撒冷“永远统一”。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Taking Arab Jerusalem was a fatal decision, for neither the Israelis nor
        the Palestinians were likely to agree to any compromise there. There
        were efforts to manage this flash point, but these arrangements often
        broke down, and the eternal city has since remained the emotional core
        of insoluble conflict. The Israeli conquest of the West Bank sparked
        similar messianic passions, and within months, Israelis began to settle
        there. Only a few realized that in the long run, occupying the
        Palestinian territories would put Israel’s Jewish majority and its shaky
        democracy in jeopardy. Just as there was no rational justification for
        the existential hysteria that had preceded the Six-Day War, there was no
        rational basis for the unbridled expansionism that took hold after it.
      </p>
      <p>
        占领阿拉伯人的东耶路撒冷是一个致命的决定，因为无论是以色列人还是巴勒斯坦人都不可能同意在那里做出任何妥协。虽然曾有过管控这一火药桶的尝试，但这些安排常常破裂，而这座永恒之城自此以后就一直是无法解决的冲突的情感核心。对约旦河西岸的占领激发了类似的救世热情，几个月之内，以色列人就开始在那里定居。只有少数人认识到，从长远来看，占领巴勒斯坦领土将危及以色列的犹太人多数和脆弱的民主。正如之前导致六日战争的发生不存在理性依据的生存恐慌一样，战后弥漫开来的无节制扩张主义也同样缺乏理性基础。
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Despite Israel’s victory, the 1967 war simply reinforced the underlying
        tensions that had long driven the Arab-Israeli conflict. Arab countries
        reaffirmed their refusal to recognize the existence of Israel; the
        Palestinians’ longing for their lost homeland intensified. Every few
        years, another war broke out. And each side did what it could to manage
        a situation that had no ready answers. Egypt was able to make peace with
        Israel in 1979 mostly because Israel was not required to give up any
        part of Palestine; under a similar logic, Jordan was able to follow suit
        in 1994. In reaching these agreements, both Arab countries abandoned the
        Palestinians in East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank, perpetuating
        the people’s identity as the orphans of the Middle East.

        尽管以色列在1967年获胜，但那场战争不过是加深了长久以来驱动阿以冲突的根本紧张态势。阿拉伯国家重申拒绝承认以色列国的存在；巴勒斯坦人对自己失去的故土的渴望则与日俱增。每隔几年，就会爆发另一场战争。双方都尽其所能来应对一个无解的局面。埃及之所以能在1979年与以色列实现和平，主要是因为以色列不必放弃任何属于巴勒斯坦的土地；基于类似的逻辑，约旦在1994年也做到了这一点。在达成这些协议的过程中，这两个阿拉伯国家把东耶路撒冷、加沙和西岸的巴勒斯坦人弃之不顾，使他们继续作为中东的孤儿而存在。

        Like Ben-Gurion and other Israeli leaders, Netanyahu does not believe
        the conflict can be solved. But he has proved even less adept than his
        predecessors at managing it. In an attempt to divide and rule the
        Palestinians and prevent them from attaining independence, he accepted
        and then encouraged the Hamas takeover of Gaza. Later, he developed the
        illusion that peace with some Gulf Arab states in the 2020 Abraham
        Accords would weaken the Palestinian cause. Implicit in these moves was
        the idea that it would be possible to control Hamas by bribing its
        leaders: Israel thus allowed Qatar to deliver Hamas millions of dollars
        in cash packed in suitcases. The Israeli government also issued work
        permits for residents of Gaza on the premise that this economic
        arrangement would restrain Hamas. This kind of bribery reflects a long
        tradition of Israeli condescension toward the Arabs—a fundamental
        contempt for them and their national feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
        内塔尼亚胡和之前的许多以色列领导人一样，并不认为巴以冲突可以得到解决，但他甚至比前任们更不擅长管控这场冲突。为了分化巴勒斯坦人并阻止他们实现独立，他先是接受、后是纵容哈马斯控制了加沙。后来，他又幻想2020年与一些海湾阿拉伯国家签署的亚伯拉罕协议将削弱巴勒斯坦事业。这些举措背后的假设是，可以通过贿赂哈马斯领导人来控制该组织：因此，以色列允许卡塔尔用行李箱给哈马斯运送数百万美元现金。以色列政府还向加沙居民发放工作许可，以为这种经济安排会遏制哈马斯。这种贿赂反映出以色列对阿拉伯人的长期傲慢态度——对他们及其民族情感的基本蔑视。

        In reality, Hamas used much of the money to acquire thousands of
        rockets, some of them obtained from Iran, that were frequently fired at
        Israeli cities. In reaction, Israel imposed a blockade on the territory
        that made Gazans even poorer. Hamas organized a fighting force and
        constructed a web of tunnels that some experts have described as the
        most extensive underground fortress in the history of modern warfare.
        Most important, Netanyahu’s approach disregarded Hamas’s ideological and
        emotional commitments, some of which outweigh even life itself, as was
        illustrated by the organization’s barbarity last October and in the
        months since. Israel has responded to this indescribable catastrophe
        with the vengeful devastation of Gaza and its people, a military
        campaign that, after more than five months, has singularly failed in its
        primary goal of “total victory” over Hamas.
      </p>
      <p>
        实际上，哈马斯把许多钱用来购买了数千枚火箭（有些是从伊朗获得的），这些火箭不时地射向以色列城市。作为回应，以色列对加沙实行封锁，使那里的居民更加贫穷。哈马斯建立了一支战斗部队，并且修建了一张错综复杂的地道网，一些专家称其为现代战争史上最庞大的地下堡垒。最重要的是，内塔尼亚胡的政策无视了哈马斯的意识形态和情感承诺——其中一些承诺甚至凌驾于生命之上，去年10月以及之后几个月里哈马斯的残暴行径就证明了这一点。对于这场无法形容的灾难，以色列的回应是怀着复仇心态摧毁加沙及其民众，而这场军事行动在5个多月后依然未能实现其“彻底战胜”哈马斯的主要目标。

        The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict is rife with futile peace
        plans. These have varied from a single binational state—a concept that
        was first proposed by Jewish intellectuals in the 1920s, and again in
        the 1940s—to transforming the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan into a
        Palestinian state, an idea that has repeatedly resurfaced since the 1967
        war. Seemingly reasonable two-state solutions have also been conceived
        over the years that might allow Israelis and Palestinians to control
        their own destinies, in some cases with some form of international
        oversight of the contested holy sites in Jerusalem.

        阿拉伯人与以色列人的冲突历史充斥着失败的和平方案，从上世纪二十年代和四十年代由犹太知识分子首次提出的一个统一的双民族国家，到将哈希姆王国（约旦）变为巴勒斯坦国（这个想法自1967年战争以来曾多次浮现），再到在某些情况下由某种形式的国际监督控制耶路撒冷有争议的圣地的各种看上去合理的两国解决方案。

        For decades, successive U.S. administrations have sponsored such
        initiatives, but rarely have they gotten beyond the concept stage,
        regardless of how favorable they might seem to one side or the other.
        Consider the “deal of the century,” a two-state solution briefly
        proposed by the Trump administration in 2020. It would have left Israeli
        settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem largely intact and given
        Israel complete security control over both. Yet Jewish settlers
        themselves did not support it because it gave parts of the West Bank, as
        well as the outskirts of East Jerusalem, to the Palestinians. That
        “deal” was merely another iteration of an enduring fantasy. There is
        little reason to believe that the Biden administration’s efforts to lay
        down a post-Gaza peace plan will be any more successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        美国政府提出这类倡议已有数十年，但不管看似对哪一方多么有利，它们很少能走出构想阶段。想想特朗普(Trump)政府在2020年短暂提出的“世纪协议”吧——这个旨在实现两国方案的计划将让以色列在约旦河西岸和东耶路撒冷的定居点基本保持原样，并让以色列完全控制两地的安全事务。然而，就连犹太定居者自己也反对该协议，因为它把部分西岸地区以及东耶路撒冷的郊区划给了巴勒斯坦人。那个“协议”只是长久以来一个白日梦的又一版本。没有理由相信拜登(Biden)政府在加沙冲突后提出和平计划的努力会取得更大成功。

        Historically, Israelis and Palestinians have occasionally shown a
        readiness to make at least some compromises. And in the early 1990s, it
        seemed that peace had won after all: the Oslo accords brought leaders of
        the two sides to the White House lawn in 1993 and subsequently earned
        them the Nobel Peace Prize. But even then, the results were evanescent.
        The following year, an Israeli fanatic massacred 29 Palestinians in a
        mosque in Hebron in the West Bank, setting off new waves of terrorist
        attacks by Palestinians. Shortly thereafter, another Israeli extremist
        assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin—just as, after the
        1979 peace accord with Israel, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had been
        assassinated by an Egyptian fanatic. Acts of terrorism and the rise of
        extremist forces on each side led to the end of the Oslo peace process,
        but in hindsight, the plan had never had much chance of success.
      </p>
      <p>
        过去，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人偶尔也表现出愿意作出某种程度的妥协。1990年代初，和平似乎最终取得了胜利：1993年，奥斯陆协议将双方领导人带到了白宫草坪上，随后他们共同获得了诺贝尔和平奖。但即便如此，成果也是短暂的。次年，一名以色列狂热分子在约旦河西岸的希伯伦清真寺枪杀了29名巴勒斯坦人，引发了新的巴勒斯坦恐怖主义袭击浪潮。不久之后，一名以色列极端分子刺杀了以色列总理拉宾——就像1979年与以色列签署和平协议后，埃及总统萨达特被一名埃及狂热分子暗杀一样。恐怖主义行为以及双方极端势力的崛起导致奥斯陆和平进程终结，但回想起来，那个计划本就不太可能取得成功。

        The common flaw in these international peace initiatives is a failure to
        contend with the inability of the Israelis and the Palestinians to
        embrace a lasting solution. Outside powers, including the United States,
        have never acted forcefully enough to stop the systematic violation of
        human rights in the Palestinian territories. But the primary reason the
        conflict endures is neither Israeli oppression of the Palestinians nor
        Palestinian terrorism, but rather the irrevocable commitment of both
        peoples to undivided land. These absolute positions have increasingly
        become the essence of collective identities on each side, and any
        compromise is likely to be denounced by significant Israeli and
        Palestinian constituencies as a national and religious betrayal.

        这些国际和平努力的共同缺陷是未能解决以色列人和巴勒斯坦人无法接受持久解决方案的问题。
        包括美国在内的一些外部力量从未采取足够坚定的行动来制止对巴勒斯坦领土上人权的系统性侵犯。
        但冲突持续不断的主要原因既不是以色列对巴勒斯坦人的压迫，也不是巴勒斯坦的恐怖主义，而是双方人民对完整土地的不可逆转的承诺。
        这些绝对的立场已经越来越成为双方集体认同的核心，任何妥协都可能被重要的以色列和巴勒斯坦群体斥为对国家和宗教的背叛。

        Evidently, existential conflicts shaped around competing visions of
        nationhood cannot be ended by grand solutions that neither side will
        support—least of all, during the most devastating war that Israelis and
        Palestinians have experienced in three-quarters of a century. But such a
        conflict can be managed in more or less reasonable ways. If a century of
        failure has made clear that the two sides are unlikely to be reconciled
        in the foreseeable future, the war in Gaza has exposed the terrifying
        cataclysm that poor handling of the conflict can bring about. When the
        fighting is over, imaginative, resourceful, and compassionate management
        of the conflict between the two sides will be more crucial than ever.
        Rather than devoting energy and political capital to deeply
        unpopular—and unsustainable—peace plans, the United States and other
        leading powers must do more to ensure that Palestinians and Israelis can
        find a safer and more tolerable existence in a world without peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        显然，围绕不同国家理念展开的存在主义冲突无法通过双方都不支持的宏大解决方案来解决——尤其是在以色列人和巴勒斯坦人经历的这场75年来最惨烈的战争期间。但这种冲突可以以更或少可接受的方式加以管控。如果说一个世纪的失败已经清楚表明，双方在可预见的将来不太可能和解，那么加沙战争则暴露了拙劣处理冲突可能造成的可怕灾难。战争结束后，富有想象力、足智多谋且充满同情心地管控双方冲突将比以往任何时候都更为重要。美国和其他大国应该致力于确保巴勒斯坦人和以色列人在没有和平的世界中找到更安全、更可容忍的存在方式，而不是把精力和政治资本浪费在深受欢迎——也无法持续——的和平计划上。

        Countless failures in the search for a solution to the conflict have
        given rise to a hypothesis that only a catastrophe of biblical
        proportions could persuade either side to rethink their delusional
        national creeds. The unfolding events in Israel and Gaza may suggest
        that both sides have not yet suffered enough. But perhaps this
        hypothesis is not rooted in reality, either.
      </p>
      <p>
        长久以来解决冲突的努力不断受挫，导致一种假设认为，只有圣经中描述的浩劫才能让双方重新思考其不切实际的民族主义信条。在以色列和加沙正在上演的事件也许表明，双方都还没有遭受足够的痛苦。但或许这个假设也脱离了现实。
